<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 3 BHK is an apartment/house with three bedrooms, a hall and a kitchen. It usually comes with three bathrooms and a balcony, depending upon the layout you choose. 3BHK homes are generally quite spacious and ideal for those living in joint families with kids or have guests over often. You can keep the master bedroom for yourself, convert one bedroom into a kid’s room and keep the other one for your guests or parents.</span></p>

<div class="card-body faqs-answer" style="padding-left: 30px;">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both of them come with three rooms, a hall and a kitchen, but the third room in a 2.5BHK is usually tiny and contained in one of the bedrooms. You can use it as a storeroom, pooja room or a small workstation. A 2.5BHK is perfect for you if you live in a nuclear family and want to live in a spacious apartment; but you must opt for a 3BHK if you live with your parents in a joint family or have friends and relatives staying over often.</span></p>

<ul>
