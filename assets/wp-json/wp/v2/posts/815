They may be side by side apartments or two-storied ones with different living units. Because of their unusual design and a large canvas, there is so much creativity to explore. Duplex homes are a notch above villas but in a much smaller size. In apartment complexes, they are created by buying apartments side by side or one above the other. Duplex <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/\">home interior designs<\/a> are also different from traditional designs. They can be two different looks, traditional juxtaposed with contemporary, a contrast of colours and styles and even two altogether different looks brought together. Duplex house interiors are built in such a way so as to break the home into several functional parts, different living units with a common kitchen and dining area ensuring privacy with an overall look.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As versatile as duplex house interior designs are, it needs good planning and creativity to bring everything together. Small canvases in interiors are easy because the rooms and their functions are fixed. It is easy to design a single bedroom, dining and kitchen. When this multiplies and rooms increase, is when true creativity comes into play with regards to the colours, aesthetics and ambience. Too much of clashing contrasting colours, a surfeit of stairs and windows can create an imbalance that throws off the look of duplex home interior design.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In duplex homes there are some elements that are more important than the rest, requiring more time and effort infused into them. Designing and decorating these elements must be done with care. A few clever tips and ideas have been elaborated below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Stairs Design For Duplex House<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As small as duplex homes might seem, it is possible to create a stunning staircase design with them. They can be the focal point of your home. Stairs are more than something that connects two spaces. They elevate and embellish homes, create drama and reflect your personality. Stairs can be created in different materials, designs and finishes. The trick to doing them is knowing what you want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In duplex homes, heavy marble staircases and elaborate traditional carvings of bannisters may overwhelm. Similarly spiral and long-winded staircases may appear inconvenient especially when homes are one above the other. Duplex stair designs work best when broken into separate levels. They are also best created lean and minimal in aesthetics. Nestle stairs in one corner of your home, instead of locating them in the centre and keep them in simple wood or light tiles that go with the overall aesthetics. Suspended steps are a great idea for their straight lines and simplicity, making the rooms appear lighter and brighter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great idea for duplex stairs design is invisible railings. Light, thin, transparent glass railing with a reinforced steel staircase has become popular and classy. Since duplex homes are not necessarily large despite the expanse of space, keeping embellishments and design elements at a minimum is a perfect way to go about designing such homes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/17060026\/transparent-stair-designs-for-duplex-house-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Transparent stairs design for duplex house is a cool new duplex house interior design in India\" class=\"wp-image-1609\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Transparent stairs in a duplex house are a cool new interior design idea<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/12154854\/under-stairs-storage-for-duplex-home-interior.jpg\" alt=\"Under stairs storage ideas for duplex home\" class=\"wp-image-50696\" style=\"width:844px;height:2421px\" width=\"844\" height=\"2421\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/12154854\/under-stairs-storage-for-duplex-home-interior.jpg 941w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/12154854\/under-stairs-storage-for-duplex-home-interior-105x300.jpg 105w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/12154854\/under-stairs-storage-for-duplex-home-interior-357x1024.jpg 357w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/12154854\/under-stairs-storage-for-duplex-home-interior-768x2202.jpg 768w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/12154854\/under-stairs-storage-for-duplex-home-interior-714x2048.jpg 714w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/12154854\/under-stairs-storage-for-duplex-home-interior-150x430.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 844px) 100vw, 844px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, Read About <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/blog\/home-interiors\/staircase-design-ideas-for-indian-homes\/\">9 Staircase Design Ideas For Indian Homes<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Let Us Look Inside A Duplex House<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As previously mentioned, the inside of a duplex house affords a large canvas to work around with. Interiors are the mainstay in a home. The colours, layout, materials used must reflect the homeowners&#8217; personality. In a duplex home, it can get conflicted because of many people living in the space and a lack of understanding of how to put things together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Begin with the colours and hues of your home to get your interiors together. Light hued pastels around the house are the best way to begin, with dark contrasting colours where you want to separate spaces. Therefore if living rooms are mildly hued, the dining space and kitchen can be darker in deeper hues. Similarly, multiple bedrooms and resting spaces can be played around with. The aim of this is to create one large space yet have individual pockets of functions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flooring is another important aspect of duplex house design that doesn\u2019t get much attention. Wooden flooring or tiled ones throughout look better than different designs everywhere. Similar red oxide or terracotta tiles in the balcony or outer areas brings together the entire look and feel of the home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding mirrors to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/\">interiors of home<\/a> lend an added spatial element while making the room appear bigger. Decorative mirrors add light and texture. They can be placed strategically, from living room foyers to staircase landings, especially in spaces that appear too constricted or small.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/17060024\/airy-inteiror-for-small-duplex-house-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Image of Indian Duplex house design from inside to showcase the airy and bright duplex home with stairs\" class=\"wp-image-1610\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The interiors of a duplex home that is airy and bright<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"mbgc-slide-caption\"><a href=\"#contactUsModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Looking for affordable designer home interiors on EMI\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/08180949\/looking-for-affordable-designer-home-interiors-on-emi.jpg \" \/><\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Small Duplex House Design<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many Most of these design inputs also apply for small duplex house design.

Duplex houses have many different ways to bring greenery indoors. From large window sills to small sit-outs, living room indoor gardens to staircase landings, clever designs can transform the look and feel of such spaces.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/17060023\/small-duplex-house-for-cozy-living-interior-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Beautiful small duplex house design images for modern indian duplex apartments.\" class=\"wp-image-1611\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Cosy living interior for small duplex house<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, Read About <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/blog\/home-interiors\/interior-design-idea-small-indian-home\/\">Interior Design Ideas For Small Indian Homes<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Keep Duplex House Interiors Green<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Duplex house design in India is just going through a sea change.
