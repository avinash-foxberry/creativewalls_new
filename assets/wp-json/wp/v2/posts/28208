Get A Smart Breakfast Counter With Fold Up Furniture Designs<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A kitchen with a dining table set up has become a modern-day kitchen interiors rule. It is efficient and saves a lot of space. Many clients prefer having a breakfast table setting by the kitchen. However, in Indian households, people often face space issues with the kitchen area, so it\u2019s difficult to make room for a breakfast setting within the kitchen. But our designers found a smart way to use the allotted space to house a breakfast nook right in the kitchen. How? With this smartly designed folding breakfast counter. When the table is not in use, it can be folded to conceal the open shelf cutlery unit. And when in use, the table is a great breakfast corner. Either way, fold up furniture designs such as these save space, add appeal and help you keep the kitchen uncluttered!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"940\" height=\"564\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/22172432\/get-a-smart-breakfast-counter-with-fold-up-folding-furniture-design.jpg\" alt=\"Smart breakfast counter with fold up furniture design\" class=\"wp-image-28218\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/22172432\/get-a-smart-breakfast-counter-with-fold-up-folding-furniture-design.jpg 940w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/22172432\/get-a-smart-breakfast-counter-with-fold-up-folding-furniture-design-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/22172432\/get-a-smart-breakfast-counter-with-fold-up-folding-furniture-design-768x461.jpg 768w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/22172432\/get-a-smart-breakfast-counter-with-fold-up-folding-furniture-design-150x90.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" \/><figcaption>It\u2019s possible to have a breakfast table in your kitchen without making major changes<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Delineate Small Rooms With A Folding Screen\u00a0<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of us who have a small space want to decorate the room in a clever way. One way is to delineate areas in an open room so that there are dedicated spaces without cluttering. Most available partition options visually restrict the openness of a space and create obstructions. But does that mean you should avoid partitions? Certainly not! Our next option in folding furniture for small spaces is this folding jaali partition that smartly segregates your room without compromising the open layout. The foldable option allows you to use the partition only when required and keep it folded when not in use. For this type of partition, use jaali folding screens as they don&#8217;t totally separate the sections.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"940\" height=\"564\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/22173010\/delineate-small-rooms-with-the-folding-furniture-screens.jpg\" alt=\"Small room with the folding furniture screens acts as a partition \" class=\"wp-image-28219\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/22173010\/delineate-small-rooms-with-the-folding-furniture-screens.jpg 940w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/22173010\/delineate-small-rooms-with-the-folding-furniture-screens-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/22173010\/delineate-small-rooms-with-the-folding-furniture-screens-768x461.jpg 768w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/22173010\/delineate-small-rooms-with-the-folding-furniture-screens-150x90.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" \/><figcaption>Sectioning your room with folding screens is a smart space-saving hack<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7.
