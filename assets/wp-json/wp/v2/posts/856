Well, consider putting your walls to use because this next design is all about making the most of limited space to construct a simplistic wall-mounted wooden temple design for your home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One way to incorporate this design would be by fitting in a wooden panel onto a wall to make it the background for your pooja room and mount drawers and shelves below this for the idol and other pooja-related storage items. The edges of the panel could further be accentuated with the right set of backlights that give your sanctum a gorgeous glow.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"mbgc-slide-caption\"><a href=\"#contactUsModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Lets plan your home interiors together, speak to designers now\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/28124401\/lets-plan-home-interiors-together.jpg \" \/><\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Another simple design to experiment with is the shelf model. Bare minimum effort goes into creating this contemporary wooden mandir that also agrees well with a tight budget.

Guests over but no space to seat them? No problem! You can now move your mini wooden mandir around your house when need be \u2013 it is afterall a piece of decor in itself now. Convenience aside, smaller furnishings are putty in hands in terms of customisation.

The finish you choose for your wooden mandir should complement your home&#8217;s color scheme. If your home interiors have metallic accents, you could add brass or silver accents to the mandir to match them. You could install LED lights inside the mandir to make it a focal point in your home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Are there any safety concerns to consider when installing a wooden mandir?<\/strong><br>Yes.

At the same time, the wiring of lights in a wooden mandir should be done by a licensed electrician to prevent electrical fires and other hazards. Make sure that the foundation of the mandir is strong enough to support the weight of the mandir.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What type of wood is best for a wooden mandir?<\/strong><br>Mandir made out of Sheesham wood are highly durable and aesthetically pleasing because of its unique grain and multiple shades.
