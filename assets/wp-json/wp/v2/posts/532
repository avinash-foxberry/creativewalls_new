It is also the space that is more prone to getting messy and untidy. With all the oil or spice stains, numerous bottles and jars, appliances, utensils and other essentials, keeping the space clean and clutter-free becomes a challenge. But an unclean kitchen can ruin your mood and the look of your entire <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/interior-design\/\">home interiors<\/a>. So here are a few kitchen hacks that will help you keep your kitchen clean and well-maintained all the time without making a hole in your pocket.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Budget-Friendly Kitchen Storage Hacks<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Functional modular storage plays a crucial part in making your kitchen look clean and clutter-free. These can house all your utensils and pantry essentials, leaving ample space for you to move around freely in your kitchen. But if you are not ready to invest in innovative modules like a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/blog\/modular-kitchen-interiors\/magic-corner-in-modular-kitchen\/\">magic corner<\/a>, tall units, appliance garage, etc, opt for some budget-friendly storage ideas for your kitchen like floating shelves, wall hooks, wall-mounted open box shelves and wicker basket units. These are quite easy to install, provide ample storage space and are reasonably priced too. You can also check out DIY kitchen storage ideas online and try some creative storage hacks for your kitchen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hacks To Keep Your Kitchen Clean And Fresh<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Owing to the amount of oil and spices used in \u201ctadkas\u201d for most Indian recipes, it is very important to keep your kitchen clean and oil-free. One of the easiest ways to hack it is to have proper ventilation in your kitchen. Make sure to have a large window in your kitchen for ample light and fresh air. You can also invest in a heavy-duty chimney. This will help you keep your kitchen clean and oil-free. Try keeping all your spice bottles and other pantry essentials in the cabinet and keep the counter free as much as possible. This will reduce your cleaning efforts and help you enjoy a hassle-free cooking experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bring In Some Greenery Into Your Kitchen Space<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the easiest <em>kitchen hacks<\/em> for a lively cooking space is to add indoor plants or succulents. They are budget-friendly, easy to maintain and add freshness to your kitchen. You can grow some microgreens and use them in your meals too. You can place it beside the window or open box cabinets or add <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/blog\/home-decor\/indoor-hanging-plants\/\">hanging planters<\/a> like the one shown in the image.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"mbgc-slide-caption\"><a href=\"#contactUsModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Get a Free Modular Kitchen Worth \u20b92 Lakhs with Your Home Interiors.\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/08183703\/designcafe-offer-free-modular-kitchen-worth-2-lakhs.jpg \" \/><\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Kitchen Decor Tips For A Lively Culinary Paradise<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If your kitchen does not need additional construction or renovation, try simple decor ideas to amp up your kitchen. You can add some light fixtures, use LED strip lights for your cabinets and backsplash or put some pendant lights on your breakfast counter area. This will make your kitchen look bright and spacious while adding to the glamour quotient of your kitchen. You can also go for some paintings, DIY wall hangers or a giant clock to dress up your walls. Another very popular way to give your kitchen a quick makeover is to experiment with vibrant colours for your kitchen. This will add a fresh, exciting vibe to your space instantly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>DOs<\/strong><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>DON&#8217;Ts<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Experiment with colours<\/td><td>Shy away from bold colours<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Add some light fixtures<\/td><td>Ignore ventilation<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Use wood-like laminate instead of wood<\/td><td>Hire carpenters<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Place a small plant near the window<\/td><td>Fill your kitchen with unnecessary appliances<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Opt For Budget-Friendly Materials And Finishes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Who doesn\u2019t love good old fashioned, luxurious materials like wood or marbles but that could bore holes in your bank account.

One of the best small kitchen ideas on a budget is to make it a kitchen cum dining area where you can entertain your guests or enjoy quick meals with your family during meal preparations. You can add a foldable breakfast counter with storage or a simple wall-mounted foldable ledge in your kitchen. Add two chairs on either side to complete the look of your kitchen cum dining area. These are space-saving and smart ways of amplifying the functionality of your small kitchen on a budget.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Go For A Trusted Interior Design Firm For Best Results<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now it\u2019s time to turn your dream into a reality and who better to help you than an experienced interior designer?
