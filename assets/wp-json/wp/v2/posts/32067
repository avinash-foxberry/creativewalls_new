It&#8217;s a place where you can showcase, reflect and flaunt your design statements. In fact, it is your personal taste of interiors that will make your home feel like yours. You can add your style to your home interiors with several design elements such as furniture choices, lightings and colour selections. One such element of modern Indian home interiors is the bar unit, precisely your wine unit. A wall-mounted wine rack is a perfect way to display your collection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your great taste in wine echoes your style and so will the wine rack in your house. If you prefer more opulent designs, your wine rack has to be lavish and larger than life to replicate your taste of heavy interiors. If you\u2019re a fan of vintage interiors, your wine rack would have more of a rustic theme. Whatever it is, the wine rack is certainly a great addition to your home bar; however, it may take an ample amount of space if not appropriately planned.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If space is a crucial factor in your home interiors, a wall-mounted wine rack will accentuate your love for wines and home decor. So, without delaying anymore, here are our designer-approved \u2018wine in a million\u2019 wall-mounted wine rack ideas that will surely glam up your place without taking a lot of space!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Simple Wall-Mounted Wine Rack Ideas For An Open Bar<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wine is an elegant choice, and so, your wine rack needs to be sleek and elegant too. We have a simple wall-mounted wine rack design that will go great with minimalistic home bar designs. The wine rack is nothing heavy but simply a unit with a wooden dowel system that elegantly hosts the wine bottles without taking much space in the bar. The wall-mounted wooden dowels are accompanied by a shelf unit to display coffee mugs and hang wine glasses. The wooden wine dowel units blend well with the bar unit&#8217;s natural interior design that features a work of solid wood. This design is also an easy DIY wine glass rack wall mount. It\u2019s ideal for people who have a limited stock of wine bottles and perfect for small apartment layouts that can&#8217;t have a bulky wine rack.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"940\" height=\"564\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/25145050\/simple-wall-mounted-wine-rack-ideas-for-an-open-bar.jpg\" alt=\"Simple wall mounted wine rack ideas for an open bar\" class=\"wp-image-32068\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/25145050\/simple-wall-mounted-wine-rack-ideas-for-an-open-bar.jpg 940w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/25145050\/simple-wall-mounted-wine-rack-ideas-for-an-open-bar-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/25145050\/simple-wall-mounted-wine-rack-ideas-for-an-open-bar-768x461.jpg 768w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/25145050\/simple-wall-mounted-wine-rack-ideas-for-an-open-bar-150x90.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" \/><figcaption>A simple wall-mounted wine rack design<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A White Wall-Mounted Wine Rack Design For The Kitchen<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Kitchens are the ideal places to display your crockery and bar units. But these furniture pieces can take up a lot of your kitchen area which may constrain free movement during cooking. However, if you have a breakfast counter, you can stack your wine collection in a simple but efficient wall-mounted rack design. The wine rack here comes as an attached vertical unit with a kitchen crockery unit. The wine rack features a wooden crate design that can house up to seven bottles. The sleek, vertical design takes a lot less space than a horizontally designed wine unit. This wine rack design utilises the room&#8217;s vertical space, letting your kitchen stay uncluttered and organised.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"940\" height=\"564\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/25145238\/a-wall-mounted-wine-rack-ideas-for-the-kitchen.jpg\" alt=\"A wall mounted wine rack ideas for the kitchen\" class=\"wp-image-32069\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/25145238\/a-wall-mounted-wine-rack-ideas-for-the-kitchen.jpg 940w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/25145238\/a-wall-mounted-wine-rack-ideas-for-the-kitchen-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/25145238\/a-wall-mounted-wine-rack-ideas-for-the-kitchen-768x461.jpg 768w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/25145238\/a-wall-mounted-wine-rack-ideas-for-the-kitchen-150x90.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" \/><figcaption>A vertically designed wall-mounted wine rack <\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to check out some uber-cool modular kitchen designs?
