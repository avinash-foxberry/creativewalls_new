Clean lines, simple shapes, and a focus on functionality characterise this style. It is all about creating a sense of calm and order in the home using minimal design elements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In European-style interior design, neutral colours are a key aspect of minimalism. This means you should consider using colours like white, beige, grey, and black for your home&#8217;s walls, floors, and furniture. However, you can also add a few bold accents to add some interest to the space. These accents can be in the form of colourful pillows, artwork, or even a statement piece of furniture.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another important aspect of European minimalism is the use of natural materials like wood, stone, and metal. These materials add warmth and texture to the space while also providing a sense of durability and longevity. You can use natural materials in the form of furniture, flooring, and even accent pieces like vases and candle holders.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"940\" height=\"564\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/13112305\/minimalist-european-style-interior-for-indian-homes.jpg\" alt=\"European-style interior adorned with Buddha vinyl and soft tones\" class=\"wp-image-45475\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/13112305\/minimalist-european-style-interior-for-indian-homes.jpg 940w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/13112305\/minimalist-european-style-interior-for-indian-homes-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/13112305\/minimalist-european-style-interior-for-indian-homes-768x461.jpg 768w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/13112305\/minimalist-european-style-interior-for-indian-homes-150x90.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" \/><figcaption>A Buddha vinyl with soft tones in this European interior design is everything you need!<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"mbgc-slide-caption\"><a href=\"#contactUsModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Get a Free Modular Kitchen Worth \u20b92 Lakhs with Your Home Interiors.\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/08183703\/designcafe-offer-free-modular-kitchen-worth-2-lakhs.jpg \" \/><\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Adding Biophilic Design To Achieve European Interiors<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/blog\/home-interiors\/biophilic-interior-design-ideas\/\">Biophilic design<\/a> is a design approach that incorporates natural elements into the home to create a connection with nature. It is a growing trend in Europe, and it could be an excellent option for Indian homeowners looking to incorporate European-style interior design trends into their homes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biophilic design uses natural materials, such as wood, stone, and plants, to create a sense of harmony and tranquillity in the home. This design approach seeks to bring the outdoors inside, providing a connection to nature that has been shown to impact health and well-being positively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One way to incorporate biophilic design into your home is by introducing plants into your living spaces. Plants add natural beauty to your home and help purify the air and create a sense of calm. You can use a mix of indoor plants, such as ferns and succulents, to create a natural and relaxing environment for your European interiors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another way to incorporate biophilic design is by using natural materials such as wood and stone in your furniture and decor. These materials add warmth and texture to your home, creating a natural and welcoming environment. Wooden furniture, for example, adds a touch of rustic charm, while stone accents, like a fireplace or a statement wall, can create a dramatic focal point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lighting is also an essential aspect of biophilic design. Natural light is best, as it helps to create a connection to the outdoors. However, if natural light is not possible, you can use artificial lighting that mimics natural light, such as full-spectrum light bulbs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"940\" height=\"564\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/13112253\/european-style-living-room-interior-with-indoor-plants.jpg\" alt=\"European-style living room interior incorporated indoor plants for a natural vibe\" class=\"wp-image-45473\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/13112253\/european-style-living-room-interior-with-indoor-plants.jpg 940w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/13112253\/european-style-living-room-interior-with-indoor-plants-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/13112253\/european-style-living-room-interior-with-indoor-plants-768x461.jpg 768w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/13112253\/european-style-living-room-interior-with-indoor-plants-150x90.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" \/><figcaption>Plants, moss frames, and a natural vibe go with this European interior design home.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Incorporating Sustainable Materials As A European Interior in Indian Homes in 2023<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With growing environmental concerns, sustainable materials are becoming more popular in European-style interior design. This trend could also gain momentum in India in 2023 as homeowners become more conscious of their environmental impact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sustainable materials such as bamboo, recycled plastic, and reclaimed wood are great options for those looking to incorporate eco-friendly elements into their homes. These materials are environmentally friendly and add a touch of natural beauty to any space.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bamboo is a versatile material that can be used in various ways, from flooring and furniture to decorative accents like vases and lampshades. It is sustainable because it proliferates and can be harvested without causing any damage to the environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recycled plastic is another sustainable material gaining popularity in European interior design. It is an eco-friendly option because it reduces the amount of plastic waste that ends up in landfills. Recycled plastic can be used in a variety of ways, from furniture and rugs to decorative accents like vases and bowls.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reclaimed wood is a sustainable option in European interiors for those looking to incorporate natural elements into their homes. It is wood that has been salvaged from old buildings or furniture and repurposed for new use. Reclaimed wood adds a touch of rustic charm to any space and is an excellent choice for flooring, furniture, and decorative accents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"940\" height=\"564\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/13112235\/european-style-interior-with-bamboo.jpg\" alt=\"Living room enhanced with eco-friendly European interior elements as a bamboo centrepiece\" class=\"wp-image-45470\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/13112235\/european-style-interior-with-bamboo.jpg 940w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/13112235\/european-style-interior-with-bamboo-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/13112235\/european-style-interior-with-bamboo-768x461.jpg 768w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/13112235\/european-style-interior-with-bamboo-150x90.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" \/><figcaption>A bamboo centrepiece adds a surreal sustainable European interior style element to this space.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, check out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/blog\/home-interiors\/sustainable-interior-design-ideas\/\">Sustainable Interior Design Ideas<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Industrial Chic Is A Fun European Style Interior Design For Indian Homes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Industrial chic is a style that has been popular in European style interior design for a few years and draws inspiration from factories and warehouses. This design approach features raw materials such as concrete, metal, and exposed brick, which are used to create a minimalist and edgy look.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To incorporate industrial chic into your home, you can start by adding metal accents and accessories. Metal light fixtures, furniture, and decorative elements, such as clocks or wall art, are a great way to add a touch of industrial style to your space. Using copper, brass, or iron finishes can add warmth and texture to your decor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another way to incorporate industrial chic is by exposing the brick walls in your home or adding a brick wallpaper for a more affordable option. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/blog\/home-decor\/7-exposed-brick-wall-decor-ideas\/\">Exposed brick walls<\/a> create a sense of raw and unpolished beauty, giving your home a rugged and edgy feel. You can also consider using concrete finishes on your floors or walls to create an industrial vibe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furniture made of raw materials such as metal, wood, or leather can also help you achieve the industrial chic look. An oversized leather sofa or a reclaimed wood coffee table can add a touch of ruggedness to your living space. You can also use industrial-style shelving units made of metal pipes or wire baskets for a unique storage solution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"940\" height=\"564\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/13112259\/industrial-chic-european-style-interior-design.jpg\" alt=\"European-style interior design living room lends industrial touch with metal lights, a sofa, indoor plants and wall art\" class=\"wp-image-45474\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/13112259\/industrial-chic-european-style-interior-design.jpg 940w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/13112259\/industrial-chic-european-style-interior-design-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/13112259\/industrial-chic-european-style-interior-design-768x461.jpg 768w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/13112259\/industrial-chic-european-style-interior-design-150x90.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" \/><figcaption>Embracing the industrial chic with the ruggedness of this European interior calls for a feast.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"mbgc-slide-caption\"><a href=\"#contactUsModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"End-to-end home interior design solutions for a stunning home\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/08180939\/end-to-end-home-interior-design-solutions-for-stunning-home.jpg \" \/><\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">European Interiors In Indian Homes Can Incorporate Warmer Tones<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Warm colours have recently been a popular trend in European-style interior design. These colours include terracotta, mustard yellow, burnt orange, and other similar shades that add warmth and a cosy atmosphere to a room.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These colours create a welcoming and comfortable environment in any space. They can be used in various ways, from wall paint to furniture upholstery to decorative accents such as throw pillows and rugs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Terracotta is a warm and earthy colour that can add a touch of rustic charm to any space. It can be used as an accent wall or with other warm colours, such as mustard yellow or burnt orange, to create a cosy and inviting atmosphere.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mustard yellow is a rich and vibrant colour that adds a sense of energy and warmth to a room. It can be used in small doses, such as in decorative pillows or as an accent wall, or in larger doses as a primary colour for furniture upholstery or curtains.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Burnt orange is a warm and bold colour that creates a sense of drama and depth in a space. It can be used as an accent wall or with other warm colours to create a bold and unique look.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Incorporating warm colours into your European-style interior design can create a sense of comfort and relaxation in your home. These colours can be used in a variety of ways, such as painting the walls, adding warm-coloured accents, or using furniture upholstered in warm shades.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To create a cohesive and harmonious look, it&#8217;s crucial to balance warm colours with cooler shades, such as greens, blues, and greys. This will help to create a sense of balance and prevent the room from feeling too overwhelming or cluttered.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"940\" height=\"564\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/13112206\/european-house-interior-india-with-warmer-tones.jpg\" alt=\"European-style house interior in India adds a cosy atmosphere with a warmer colour\" class=\"wp-image-45465\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/13112206\/european-house-interior-india-with-warmer-tones.jpg 940w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/13112206\/european-house-interior-india-with-warmer-tones-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/13112206\/european-house-interior-india-with-warmer-tones-768x461.jpg 768w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/13112206\/european-house-interior-india-with-warmer-tones-150x90.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" \/><figcaption>Warmer tones add to the cosy quotient of the European-style interiors in this home<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Mixed Metals For An Eclectic European Style Interior Design<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mixed metals, a trend popular in European style interior design, combine various metals such as brass, copper, and silver to add a touch of glamour and sophistication to any space. This can be achieved through decorative accents such as lamps, vases, and picture frames or through larger pieces such as furniture or fixtures. Mixing metals can also create an interesting contrast and visual appeal, making it a great way to add depth and texture to your home decor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mixed metals can be incorporated into Indian home design in many ways. For example, you can add brass or copper accents to traditional furniture pieces, such as a wooden chest or a carved <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/blog\/bedroom-interiors\/wooden-headboard-designs\/\">wooden headboard<\/a>. These accents can be in the form of handles, knobs, or decorative trim.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another way to incorporate mixed metals is by using metallic light fixtures, such as copper pendant lights or silver chandeliers. These fixtures can add a touch of elegance and sophistication to a room while providing functional lighting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mixed metal decor can also be added through smaller accents such as photo frames, candle holders, or decorative trays. These items can be placed on coffee tables, shelves, or mantels to add visual interest and create a cohesive look.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"940\" height=\"564\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/13112247\/european-style-interior-with-mixed-metals.jpg\" alt=\"Living room has a European-style interior with a mixture of brass accent furniture, vases, and picture frames\" class=\"wp-image-45472\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/13112247\/european-style-interior-with-mixed-metals.jpg 940w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/13112247\/european-style-interior-with-mixed-metals-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/13112247\/european-style-interior-with-mixed-metals-768x461.jpg 768w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/13112247\/european-style-interior-with-mixed-metals-150x90.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" \/><figcaption>Embracing a blend of copper and brass, this European interior demands a classic Indian twist!<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Multifunctional Furniture As A European Style Design Trend<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Multifunctional furniture is a trend that is gaining popularity in European interiors due to limited space in many homes. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/blog\/home-interiors\/space-saving-furniture-small-indian-homes\/\">Space-saving furniture<\/a> such as sofa beds, storage ottomans, and nesting tables can help maximise living areas while providing functionality and versatility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, Indian homeowners looking to optimise their limited living spaces can benefit from incorporating multifunctional furniture into their home design. This type of furniture can serve multiple purposes, making it an excellent option for smaller homes or apartments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/blog\/living-room-interiors\/space-saving-sofa-bed\/\">sofa bed<\/a> can be used as a couch during the day and then easily transformed into a bed for guests at night. Storage ottomans can be used for seating as well as a place to store extra blankets, pillows, or other items. Nesting tables can be used separately as side tables or together as a larger coffee table.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"940\" height=\"564\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/13112223\/european-style-house-interior-with-study-cum-tv-unit.jpg\" alt=\"European-style house interior in India with study cum tv unit\" class=\"wp-image-45468\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/13112223\/european-style-house-interior-with-study-cum-tv-unit.jpg 940w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/13112223\/european-style-house-interior-with-study-cum-tv-unit-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/13112223\/european-style-house-interior-with-study-cum-tv-unit-768x461.jpg 768w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/13112223\/european-style-house-interior-with-study-cum-tv-unit-150x90.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" \/><figcaption>Always in style, the multifunctional TV cum study unit in this European interior space is all the vibe!<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And with that, we end our blog on European-style interior design trends in your Indian home in 2023.

Avoid harsh, cool lighting and opt for warm, yellow-toned light bulbs instead.<\/li><li><strong>Use A Mix Of Lighting Sources:<\/strong> European-style interiors often use a mix of lighting sources to create a layered and balanced look. This can include table lamps, floor lamps, and overhead lighting.<\/li><li><strong>Consider The Scale Of The Room: <\/strong>The scale of the room is an important factor to consider when choosing lighting.
