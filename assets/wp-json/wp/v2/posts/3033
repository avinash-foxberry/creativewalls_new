Our tryst with masalas and spices, cutlery and vessels of different materials and elaborate foods we prepare makes kitchens undergo a daily onslaught of work. Kitchen organisation in our homes is, therefore, a tough chore made even more complex with the variety of cuisines we prepare. Storing utensils and food ingredients is one of the biggest peeves for most women in Indian kitchens. Despite storing intelligently and even buying less, one always finds things spilling over to the countertop, dining table and even the sink.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organisation is the key to keep ourselves sane, yet churn out wonderful dishes day in and day out for our friends and families. A great organisation isn\u2019t as hard as it looks. It is more than just putting everything out of sight and reach. It means finding things when you need them, separating essentials from occasional use, and prioritising important tasks. All this so good food doesn\u2019t have to be cooked at the cost of slogging in the kitchen for hours on end.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While kitchen design isn\u2019t tough in itself, here are 10 few design ideas and tips to come up with great kitchen organisation for Indian homes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Declutter Your Kitchen Counters<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Kitchen counters are where all the hard work actually gets done. It\u2019s the battleground where food is cut, sliced, diced, mixed, fried and cooked. As such kitchen counters have to be free and spacious for work to actually begin. Seeing them neat and efficient is ideal but what also happens is that it invites unnecessary stuff to be stored on them, often indefinitely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Simple Kitchen Organization Hacks | Best Storage Hacks For Your Kitchen | Kitchen Organization Ideas\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/oeIYad5VDjo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Kitchen Railings<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Kitchen counters become cluttered with things all the time. If it isn\u2019t dishes with cooked food then utensils, oftentimes spice bottles and unused cutlery find their way there. If you want an empty countertop to work on, or simply to make you feel happy about the space, try kitchen railings which can hold your baskets, spice bottles and other cutlery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/17054524\/how-to-organise-a-kitchen.jpg\" alt=\"A kitchen organiser with hanging organisers where you can organise any of the items in kitchen organisation ideas \" class=\"wp-image-2149\"\/><figcaption>Kitchen railings to store spices and ingredients give you extra room to cook in<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"mbgc-slide-caption\"><a href=\"#contactUsModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Up your kitchen organisation game with our storage ideas\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/17142233\/up-your-kitchen-organisation-game-with-our-storage-ideas.jpg \" \/><\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Rack Up Your Cups And Plate<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is easier to wash and dry utensils that are properly segregated according to their function. Plate and cup racks, spoon holders, frying pan hangers and magnetic knife boards are some organisation ideas for the counters. These ensure that cooking supplies and all essentials are situated right next to where you cook and convenient to manage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/17054515\/kitchen-organization-ideas.jpg\" alt=\"Hanging racks which tell you how to organise a kitchen with iron hanging which can hang utensils for kitchen organisation ideas\" class=\"wp-image-2150\"\/><figcaption>Racks to dry plates and cups over the sink<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bottle Up All Your Condiments<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bottles are now available in a variety of different sizes and for different purposes. Cooking oils and ghee, frying oils and liquid items are best managed when stored in long bottles at convenient places throughout the kitchen. Bottle pull-outs are great organisation accessories and using them decreases spillage and leaks keeping your counter clutter-free.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/17054514\/kitchen-organization-ideas-for-your-home.jpg\" alt=\"Pull-out drawers storing bottled ingredients are a great storage hack\" class=\"wp-image-2151\"\/><figcaption>Pull-out drawers storing bottled ingredients are a great storage hack<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Increase Pantry Storage Space<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pantry storage just doesn\u2019t suffice. There was a time earlier where a separate room next to your kitchen was used for vegetables and storage of food grains. With the advent of refrigerators, pantry sizes began to shrink and food began to increasingly clog kitchen counter. The trick to increasing pantry storage in small kitchens of today is the intelligent use of space.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Shelf And Drawer Storage<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most old household pantries are created with large and tall shelves, that is inconvenient and a waste of space. Big vessels and cutlery cannot fit into them, and sometimes space is more than required. Additional space in pantries can be created while maintaining them contemporary and chic, with special pull-out shelves of different heights and storage baskets of varied sizes. This keeps your stuff organised, creating the right kind of spaces. Pull-out shelves can also be tailored with single-height and double-height shelves as per your design and requirements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/17054518\/kitchen-drawer-organizer-for-your-home.jpg\" alt=\"Kitchen drawer organiser with a cabinet storage an gas fitted inside with a lot of space on countertop for kitchen organisation products \" class=\"wp-image-2152\"\/><figcaption>Sleek and stylish kitchen cabinet storage for better organisation<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Vertical Niche Storage<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Modular kitchens have lower shelves that are a variation of drawers and stand-alone spaces. Placing things horizontally &#8211; utensils, cutlery and bottles &#8211; is more space occupying. The area that can take up several little items, must make do with just one when things are placed horizontally. Small vertical storage can be created under kitchen counters, next to storage bins and wherever small niches can be found. These when used to store daily use bottles of oil, vinegar, ghee are convenient and easy to access.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/17054516\/kitchen-organisation-products-for-home.jpg\" alt=\"Kitchen cabinet organizers with pull out mechanism to put trays and plates in the top and bottles storage in the bottom for kitchen  counter organization\" class=\"wp-image-2153\"\/><figcaption>Storage niches for bottles and smaller items is a smarter way to organise everything<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"mbgc-slide-caption\"><a href=\"https:\/\/qarpentri.com\/collections\/kitchen?utm_source=designcafe&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=36546\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Budget friendly kitchen designs just for you\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/01170648\/budget-friendly-kitchen-designs-just-for-you.jpg \" \/><\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Storage Tricks That Stick<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Corkboards, magnetic strips and rubber mats provide convenient storage for spoons, forks, cups and other small items and cutlery. Placing them around the kitchen forces you to keep things in their place and reduces clutter around the main kitchen area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/17054522\/kitchen-cabinet-organizers-for-your-home.jpg\" alt=\"Kitchen organizer rack and a countertop to place the cutleries on the countertop and jars filled with pulses and a knife organiser hanging on the wall which tells us how to organise a kitchen\" class=\"wp-image-2154\"\/><figcaption>Magnetic storage on kitchen walls is a trick that sticks<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Maximise Usage Of Kitchen Cabinets<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Kitchen cabinets are usually designed based on the layout and available space, but there\u2019s no reason why they can\u2019t be used for more than just storage of utensils and cutlery. The space on and around cabinets can also be optimised to ensure they are useful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Kitchen Cabinets For Better Organisation<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Cabinets have an outer area that can be designed aesthetically to store away other accessories &#8211; washcloths, hangers, plastics. With clever addition of handles, racks and bars for aprons and clothes, converting smaller nooks into bottle storage, installing specially designed bottle pullouts and maximising every inch of kitchens, cabinets can be optimised for space.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/17054519\/kitchen-counter-organization-for-your-home.jpg\" alt=\"Kitchen shelf organizer with additional storage and pull out trays to store fruits and vegetables with horizontal partitions in kitchen shelf organiser\" class=\"wp-image-2155\"\/><figcaption>Easy additional storage for kitchen cabinets go a long way<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Magic Corners Are Clever Kitchen Organisation Hacks<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Small or large modular kitchens have many areas that are unused or lie waste. While it didn\u2019t matter in older kitchens, today because of the paucity of space every inch is important. Magic corners are a boon. In modern modular kitchens, they utilise the dead space in corners of lower cabinets. Magic corners help in accessing the space at the back of the cabinets. They come in a variety of shapes and accessories that make this possible. The rotating corner trays or kitchen carousels are centrally fixed but can be rotated to get items closer. The Le Mans magic corner is a kidney-shaped tray that unfolds itself out of the corner cabinet when pulled. Similarly, pull-outs are metal baskets designed in a different manner to maximise storage. These kitchen organisation tools make it easy to save more, in less space.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/17054513\/kitchen-organizer-rack-for-your-home.jpg\" alt=\"Kitchen organiser india with pull out circular drawers below the countertop which perfectly suits for small kitchen organisation\" class=\"wp-image-2157\"\/><figcaption>Convenient corner storage in lower cabinets brig dead spaces to life<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Buy Less, Store Less<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing many of us in Indian households love to do is to buy more stuff. We imagine that more utensils and cutlery, more plastic storage and appliances will make our lives easier or organisation better. The opposite is true. The better organisation comes with owning less, using storage intelligently and keeping only what is needed. Collecting plastic containers for storage is an obsession you must actively stop. There\u2019s no end to it and it will end up clogging all spaces of your kitchen. Any container that is stained, cracked or doesn\u2019t seal must be sent for recycling. They are not useful and are certainly not good for health. Try and replace all your plastic items with steel or glass. Or reuse plastic as planters and for storage of stationery and other items.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/17054523\/how-to-organise-indian-kitchen.jpg\" alt=\"Kitchen organiser set of dabbas to store all the pulses above the countertop which is perfectly suitable for small kitchen organisation ideas\" class=\"wp-image-2158\"\/><figcaption>Foodgrains stored in proper containers look good and are durable too<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"mbgc-slide-caption\"><a href=\"#contactUsModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Space saving kitchen designs that offer 20% extra space!\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/06165035\/space-saving-kitchen-designs-that-offer-20-extra-space-scaled.jpg \" \/><\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Purge the Pantry And Organise By Use<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than buying unwanted groceries or storing unused cutlery and food, remove them regularly. Detox your kitchen as regularly as you detox yourself. This keeps you in better health, keeps the kitchen clean and sanitised and everyone in the family healthy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/17054512\/kitchen-shelf-organizer-to-hang-utensils.jpg\" alt=\"Kitchen organisation tips to store all the pans at one place by hanging them on the wall on a horizontal rod for kitchen organization\" class=\"wp-image-2159\"\/><figcaption>Pots and pans stored in the kitchen by the use<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Kitchen organisation isn\u2019t just about moving things around and creating space for convenience. It also means going deeper to understand how it can be made longterm and self-sustaining. Depending on what works for you, use all of the above organisation tips or just a few and stick to them regularly.<\/p>\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"row blog-form\">\n\t<div class=\"offset-lg-3 col-lg-6
