We all love the monsoons and the cosiness it brings. No matter how much we like sunny days, we all love it when the clouds thunder and mark the beginning of another beautiful monsoon. However, we know monsoons can be tricky because the rains can damage houses, especially if you have wooden flooring and furniture. Though woodwork enhances the interiors of a home, it can quickly absorb moisture, feel damp and get damaged easily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hence, it is of utmost importance to be ready to save your woodwork at home this monsoon. So, take out your DIY gloves and get ready to embrace the beauty of monsoons without the fear of damaging your lovely wooden furniture pieces!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How To Care For Your Wooden Furniture During The Monsoon?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wooden furniture is prone to water damage; hence, you need to properly care for your wooden furniture pieces during the monsoon. Wooden furniture pieces are also expensive, so you wouldn\u2019t want to get them damaged by the seasonal rains. Here are a few hacks to protect your wooden furnishings during the monsoon:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"mbgc-slide-caption\"><a href=\"#contactUsModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Want to see your dream home before its built\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/28145609\/want-to-see-dream-home-before-its-build.jpg \" \/><\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Keep Your Wooden Furniture Away From The Walls<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Damp walls, even when there are no apparent leakages, are bad for your furniture. So, keep your furniture pieces like wooden showcase units, wooden bookshelves, beds, wardrobes, etc. away from the walls. Keep some distance between the furniture, especially the bedroom and living room wooden furniture, and the walls to stay protected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"940\" height=\"564\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/18173807\/keep-wooden-furniture-away-from-the-wall.jpg\" alt=\"Keep bedroom wooden furniture and living room furniture away from the wall to stay protected during monsoon season.\" class=\"wp-image-24347\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/18173807\/keep-wooden-furniture-away-from-the-wall.jpg 940w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/18173807\/keep-wooden-furniture-away-from-the-wall-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/18173807\/keep-wooden-furniture-away-from-the-wall-768x461.jpg 768w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/18173807\/keep-wooden-furniture-away-from-the-wall-150x90.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Keep Your Wooden Furniture Items Away From The Windows<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Water from your windows and balconies can drench your precious wooden furniture. So, keep your wooden furniture away from the doors, windows and balcony. Also, keep your wooden window frames dry by wiping away the water spillage from rains.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Go For DIY Water Absorbent Solutions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also protect your wooden furniture by using camphor balls. Yes, camphor balls are readily available and are excellent water absorbents. Keep them inside your wardrobes, in between your clothes, inside your showcase unit\u2019s shelves, etc. Camphors can also keep the termites in check during the monsoons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"940\" height=\"564\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/18173715\/diy-water-absorbent-solution-for-wooden-furniture-wardrobe.jpg\" alt=\"DIY tips for wooden furniture wardrobe using camphor balls protects from water absorbents.\" class=\"wp-image-24341\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/18173715\/diy-water-absorbent-solution-for-wooden-furniture-wardrobe.jpg 940w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/18173715\/diy-water-absorbent-solution-for-wooden-furniture-wardrobe-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/18173715\/diy-water-absorbent-solution-for-wooden-furniture-wardrobe-768x461.jpg 768w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/18173715\/diy-water-absorbent-solution-for-wooden-furniture-wardrobe-150x90.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Protect Your Wooden Furniture By Oiling Them<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>During the monsoon, your wooden furniture may swell by absorbing moisture. It happens mostly in your wooden furniture doors and drawers. The best way to fight this is by oiling your furniture or using spray-on wax to protect your wooden furnishings from absorbing moisture and bulking up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Apply Lacquer Finish Coats On Your Wooden Furniture<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Polishing your wooden furniture once a year or just ahead of the monsoon days can help you immensely. You can apply a coat of lacquer on your furniture pieces to fill the minute pores and protect them from swelling up with moisture. Using a coat of lacquer on your wooden living room furniture, bedroom pieces, etc., can also help increase their lives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"940\" height=\"564\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/18173758\/infographic-of-tips-to-care-for-wooden-furniture-in-monsoon.jpg\" alt=\"Infographic of tips to care for your wooden furniture during monsoon season.\" class=\"wp-image-24346\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/18173758\/infographic-of-tips-to-care-for-wooden-furniture-in-monsoon.jpg 940w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/18173758\/infographic-of-tips-to-care-for-wooden-furniture-in-monsoon-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/18173758\/infographic-of-tips-to-care-for-wooden-furniture-in-monsoon-768x461.jpg 768w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/18173758\/infographic-of-tips-to-care-for-wooden-furniture-in-monsoon-150x90.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How To Care For Your Wooden Flooring During The Monsoon?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides your wooden furniture, you also need to keep some tips handy for your wooden flooring. Wooden flooring adds a breathtaking natural appeal to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/\">home interiors<\/a>. It is, therefore, one of the most-loved flooring designs for home interiors, especially in colder areas. However, these aesthetically pleasing wooden floors are prone to water damage. Therefore, here are some handy DIY tips to protect your wooden floors during heavy rains:<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Protect Your Wooden Floors By Sealing Their Leakage Points<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have old wooden floors, you might want to check for leakage spots around the corners and on the surface. These spots can be the places from where water gets into your home and damage your precious wooden flooring. Seal the weak areas or go for a complete repair of the flooring. You can use polyurethane sealants to cure seals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Decorate The Wooden Floors With Highly Absorbent Mats<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As your wooden flooring can absorb moisture, go for super absorbent rubber mats as they are great for water resistance. You can place these mats at your entryways, near the high traffic areas, in front of the bathroom, balcony, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PS: Don\u2019t forget to select the non-slippery rubber mats.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"mbgc-slide-caption\"><a href=\"#contactUsModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Get a free design consultation from design cafe\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/27144955\/get-free-design-consultation.jpg \" \/><\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Keep Your Wooden Floors Clean And Dry<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>During the monsoons, it is imperative to keep regularly cleaning and checking on your wooden floors.
