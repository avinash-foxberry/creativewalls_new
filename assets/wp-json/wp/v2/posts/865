Indian balcony designs are often under-explored and under-utilized because of the least amount of attention given to them. As much as can be done with them, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/interior-design\/balcony-design\/\">best balcony designs<\/a> are those that allow the natural look and feel of the space to shine through.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Balconies hold a special place in Indian homes. These open spaces have always been a part of our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/\">home interiors<\/a> since time immemorial, when houses used to be designed with large courtyards, open lawns and stone sit-outs and benches that ran through the entire outside area. With time and the lack of space, they began to be made smaller and restrictive in their space. Today most apartments and houses have balconies that are cherished, but not much effort put into their design and decor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indian balconies are healing and calming. Because of our Indian nature to connect with neighbours, comment on their well-being and be involved with other families, these balconies provide an avenue that facilitates such sharing. We get to enjoy nature and natural surroundings with loved ones. In apartments especially, these balconies serve as veritable canvases that can be decorated and designed the way we want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Balconies look great if done well. Their sizes don\u2019t matter and much can be done in limited spaces with little means. All it needs is imagination,&nbsp; a bunch of ideas and a definite plan of how everything can be put together seamlessly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Balconies are often square or rectangular in shape. But there are round ones too. Some others have just an extension of a window ledge, while others are created by adjoining ones joined together. Irrespective of the balcony interiors and availability of space, below are a few great ideas to explore in Indian balcony designs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Small Is Beautiful: Balcony Designs For Tiny Homes And Apartments<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/blog\/home-interiors\/small-balcony-design-ideas\/\">Small balconies<\/a> are popular in apartments that go from 700 square feet and upwards. Often, they are added as a distraction and rarely as a space to relax and decorate. Although tiny, such balconies can still be styled without compromising on comfort or style. Add a chair or two and a small coffee table, line the walls with potted plants and transform it into a cosy space. You can even create this space as an exclusive bar or breakfast counter to gather with friends or family.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/17055930\/balcony-design-for-indian-homes-with-tiny-bar-counter-set-up-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Balcony design for homes with tiny bar counter set up for indian balcony designs\" class=\"wp-image-1787\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">A tiny bar counter set up in a small balcony<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"mbgc-slide-caption\"><a href=\"#contactUsModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Lets plan your home interiors together, speak to designers now\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/28124401\/lets-plan-home-interiors-together.jpg \" \/><\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Rustic Balconies Are Reminiscent Of Old Times<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Rusticity is reminiscent of the days of old, when older, discarded furniture would be bought, redesigned and placed around for the family to gather together. Rusticity has an unfinished quality, textured, hewn and blends well into an old space. Furniture made of wood, designs that are simple and functional, a porch swing and pergola, wooden decks and stone pots complete the look and bring together the space beautifully. Complete the look with bright contrast cushions and your space is all ready for some indulgence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/17055929\/balcony-design-for-indian-apartment-with-simple-rustic-chairs-and-tables-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Balcony Simple rustic chairs and tables are great ideas to explore in indian balcony designs\" class=\"wp-image-1788\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Simple rustic chairs and tables embellish this balcony space<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, Read more about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/blog\/home-interiors\/outdoor-balcony-furniture-design-ideas\/\">Outdoor Balcony Furniture Designs<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reuse, Repurpose, Recycle &#8211; Decor That\u2019s Easy On The Pocket<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Balconies don\u2019t have to be exorbitantly designed spaces. They provide an alternate space to relax and unwind, sip on tea or a get-together with friends. The ambience has to be comfortable. One way of doing this is by recycled balcony designs. They are great to work with as DIY projects, can be redesigned and moved around whenever you wish to change the decor. Logs and tree stumps can be used as seating and tables, discarded rubber tyres wrapped with cloth as stools, plastic bottles reused as planter pots. There\u2019s so much to work around when the theme is recycle and reuse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/17055928\/recycled-balcony-interior-designs-for-indian-homes-and-apartments-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Recycled balcony interior designs for indian balcony designs\" class=\"wp-image-1789\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Balcony furniture made of discarded pallets and wood<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"mbgc-slide-caption\"><a href=\"#contactUsModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Get a free design consultation from design cafe\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/27144955\/get-free-design-consultation.jpg \" \/><\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p> Also, Explore more about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/blog\/home-interiors\/balcony-decoration-ideas\/\">Balcony Decoration Ideas<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Put The Limelight On Lighting<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Stylish, eye-catching and using lights to set the mood are balconies where the emphasis is on lighting rather than decor and furniture. Water bodies, stone walls and hidden lighting set into the balcony can transform the space especially during evenings when the sun goes down. These balconies need great design and careful planning to ensure they don\u2019t become overwhelmed yet enhance the look and feel of the balcony space perfectly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/17055926\/multi-hued-stylish-lighting-for-balcony-design-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Indian balcony design with stone walls and hidden lighting set enhance the look and feel\" class=\"wp-image-1790\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Subtle multi-hued stylish lighting for balcony design<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hang It Down Balcony Design<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some balconies aren\u2019t spread out. Because of the paucity of space and the need to do more in less, the way they are designed works great vertically. From fibre mats as screening, hanging trellis and bamboo pots for plants, wooden shelves and small furniture, vertical balconies look and feel cosy and do not occupy much space.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/17055925\/pots-and-tables-hung-from-ceiling-and-wall-of-balcony-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Indian balcony design has fibre mats, hanging trellis and bamboo pots, perfect for apartment balcony design and Indian homes\" class=\"wp-image-1791\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Pots and tables hung from the ceiling and wall of a balcony<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more About <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/blog\/home-interiors\/best-balcony-railing-designs-for-indian-homes\/\">Balcony Railing Designs For Indian Homes<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Wicker Furniture Is A Wicked Design Trick<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s lovely to have a complete balcony in a wicker-themed design. This is easy to put together, looks great and keeps the design cohesive and smart. Wicker furniture is also eco-friendly. When paired with textured cotton material, easy cushions and seating, they make for a lovely ambience to sit and talk around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/17055924\/wicker-furniture-for-small-balcony-interior-design-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Lovely to have a complete balcony in a wicker-themed design for indian balcony design\" class=\"wp-image-1792\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Wicker furniture for small balconies<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Some Cool Contrasts In Balcony Designs For Indian Homes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Colour can be both underwhelming and overwhelming, especially in balconies that have limited surface area in the first place. Too much of vibrant hues can put you off and isn\u2019t apt for relaxation. On the other hand, dull, insipid decor and designs affect your overall mood. Coloured balconies therefore must be designed intelligently &#8211; contrast coloured cushions on beige furniture, bright colourful rugs and carpets surrounded by a surfeit of greenery, coloured pots and knick-knacks strewn all around a neutral coloured decor. Colour can uplift moods and in balconies define the look and feel of the space.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/17055922\/design-bright-coloured-balconies-with-flowers-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Use cool colour contrasts for your indian balcony designs\" class=\"wp-image-1793\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Bright coloured balconies studded with flowers make it a happy place<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Garden Up With Those Blooms<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pots and plants are the mainstays of most balconies. What if these are therefore explicitly done up to grow flowers and plants and veggies. Besides providing a constant source of sustenance, they also enliven the space, brighten moods and you will be doing a great service to nature looking after one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/17055921\/design-your-balcony-interior-with-garden-using-flowers-and-plants-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Design your indian balcony design interior with flowers and plants looks like a garden for balcony interior design india\" class=\"wp-image-1794\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Recycled plastic bottles used to grow flowers and plants in balconies are a beautiful embellishment<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, Explore more about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/blog\/home-interiors\/balcony-garden-design-ideas\/\">Balcony Garden Design Ideas<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"mbgc-slide-caption\"><a href=\"#contactUsModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Do you want a free design consultation, call our designers\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/28125622\/do-you-want-free-design-consultation.jpg \" \/><\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Minimal Balcony Design Is Resplendent<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It might sound like an oxymoron, but Indian balconies can be simple, minimally designed and yet look resplendent. Small footstools, a large carpet, artfully chosen brass chandeliers and a bare minimal design palette exudes sophistication and a cosy warmth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/17055920\/minimal-wall-designed-indian-balcony-with-pots-and-furniture-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Indian balconies design can be minimal with pots and furniture\" class=\"wp-image-1795\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">A minimal wall designed balcony with pots and furniture is classy decor theme<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, Explore more about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/blog\/home-interiors\/balcony-chair-table-design\/\">Balcony Chair Table Designs<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Come Winter Chill<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re surprised about how balconies can be used in winter, the trick to them is designing them with an inviting warmth. It\u2019s a wonderful feeling to sit out on the balcony in enveloped by warmth while the cold bites outside.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/17055919\/design-with-woollen-rugs-and-plants-in-indian-apartment-balcony-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Warm rugs thrown over sofas, thick shaggy carpets, small tables in balcony for warm for indian balcony designs\" class=\"wp-image-1796\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Woollen rugs and plants on a balcony for a warm and cosy winter vibe<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Warm rugs thrown over sofas, thick shaggy carpets, small tables and stools to place hot mugs of tea and coffee and even a book stand to keep you busy, make for great winter balcony decor.
