But let that not worry you. Our simple checklist of best practices for getting your hardwood flooring right in the first go will help you. Read on.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Preparation for Best Hardwood Flooring Installation<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Take some time to explore reference images on the kind of hardwood flooring that resonates with your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/interior-design\/\">home interiors<\/a>. Whether you&#8217;ve already had a free consultation with one of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/\">DesignCafe&#8217;s<\/a> designers or have chosen an option based on blog images, gathering inspiration and making informed decisions for a satisfactory result is crucial. As we delve deeper into the installation process, make sure to note down the essential details.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Select the type of hardwood flooring that aligns with your design preferences and practical needs. Whether you opt for solid hardwood or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/blog\/home-interiors\/engineered-wood-flooring\/\">engineered hardwood<\/a>, consider factors like room usage, foot traffic, cleaning efforts and humidity levels. Engineered hardwood flooring offers stability and suits areas with fluctuating humidity levels. Solid hardwood flooring has a raw, natural appeal and can be sanded and refinished multiple times, making it a preferred choice for long-lasting elegance in well-maintained spaces.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"940\" height=\"564\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/21102351\/hardwood-flooring-installation-preparation.jpg\" alt=\"Hardwood flooring installation research and preparation for aligning your requirements\" class=\"wp-image-51071\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/21102351\/hardwood-flooring-installation-preparation.jpg 940w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/21102351\/hardwood-flooring-installation-preparation-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/21102351\/hardwood-flooring-installation-preparation-768x461.jpg 768w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/21102351\/hardwood-flooring-installation-preparation-150x90.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Research before you decide on your option<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cost to Install Solid &amp; Engineered Hardwood Floors<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Start by measuring the area where you wish to install the hardwood flooring, just one bedroom or the entire house. This includes accurately measuring the length and width of the room and estimating the amount of hardwood flooring you will need while purchasing the right materials. Take a measuring tape, write down the dimensions, or communicate with the hired designers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you plan to install the flooring yourself, ensure you have all the required tools and materials for the installation process. You&#8217;ll need a tape measure, chalk line, circular saw, jigsaw, flooring adhesive, nail gun, and other safety equipment.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note: If DesignCafe handles your interiors, wooden flooring falls under our services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"940\" height=\"564\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/21102341\/hardwood-flooring-installation-cost.jpg\" alt=\"Solid and engineered hardwood flooring installation cost ideation\" class=\"wp-image-51070\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/21102341\/hardwood-flooring-installation-cost.jpg 940w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/21102341\/hardwood-flooring-installation-cost-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/21102341\/hardwood-flooring-installation-cost-768x461.jpg 768w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/21102341\/hardwood-flooring-installation-cost-150x90.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Prepare your space for a successful installation<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"mbgc-slide-caption\"><a href=\"#contactUsModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Design inspiring home interiors that sparkn joy!\" src=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/design-inspiring-home-interiors-that-sparkn-joy.jpg \" \/><\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How To Install Hardwood Floors: Process\u00a0<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How To Install Hardwood Floors On Uneven Subfloor<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The subfloor is the base or foundation on which the hardwood flooring gets installed. Ensure the subfloor is clean, levelled, and free of obstruction or debris. If there is any unevenness or damage, use self-levelling compounds or plywood to create a smooth and stable base for the seamless hardwood flooring installation process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let the hardwood flooring acclimate to the project room&#8217;s temperature and humidity levels for at least 48 hours before installation. This precautionary measure prevents the wood&#8217;s expansion or contraction after installation. Hiring a credible interior design team is crucial for a quality installation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the floor design pattern selected, set out the layout of the hardwood planks to ensure symmetry. Consider the direction of the planks in relation to the room&#8217;s entrance and the source of natural light.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"940\" height=\"564\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/21102332\/subfloor-hardwood-flooring-installation.jpg\" alt=\"Hardwood flooring installation process on uneven subfloor\" class=\"wp-image-51069\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/21102332\/subfloor-hardwood-flooring-installation.jpg 940w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/21102332\/subfloor-hardwood-flooring-installation-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/21102332\/subfloor-hardwood-flooring-installation-768x461.jpg 768w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/21102332\/subfloor-hardwood-flooring-installation-150x90.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Don&#8217;t rush when it comes to quality flooring<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hardwood Floor Installation And Refinishing: Get To Work!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to hardwood floor installation, you have three main methods to choose from:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Nail-Down Installation:<\/strong> This cost-effective method involves nailing each plank directly to the subfloor, providing secure stability. It&#8217;s a traditional approach suitable for both solid and engineered hardwood.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Glue-Down Installation: <\/strong>An adhesive or glue is applied to the subfloor(works best for concrete), and the planks are glued in dedicated areas. It&#8217;s commonly used for engineered hardwood and is beneficial for areas with moisture concerns.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Click-Lock Installation:<\/strong> A quick and simple technique that involves locking the planks without attaching them to the subfloor. Instead, they securely snap together, perfect for DIY projects and engineered hardwood.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Begin the installation by laying the first row of hardwood planks along the longest wall. Maintain a small gap between the planks and the wall to accommodate natural expansion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Post installation, let the hardwood flooring settle down for a few days before moving furniture back into the room. This helps prevent any damage or shifting of the planks. And your stunning floor is ready! There is nothing like walking on your new fancy ground beneath your feet.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"940\" height=\"564\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/21102323\/hardwood-floor-refinishing.jpg\" alt=\"Hardwood floor installation and refinishing for enhancing the look of your home\" class=\"wp-image-51068\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/21102323\/hardwood-floor-refinishing.jpg 940w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/21102323\/hardwood-floor-refinishing-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/21102323\/hardwood-floor-refinishing-768x461.jpg 768w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/21102323\/hardwood-floor-refinishing-150x90.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Get ready to accept compliments!<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hardwood flooring is an excellent option for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/blog\/home-interiors\/modern-interior-design-guide\/\">modern<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/blog\/home-interiors\/traditional-interior-design-ideas\/\">traditional<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/blog\/home-interiors\/5-ways-to-make-your-home-into-rustic-retreat\/\">rustic<\/a> or any other interior design style.
