This helps in creating a more liberal and airy interior design for homes. In such arrangements, most areas overlap with each other. Hence, designers use furniture to delineate areas in open layout homes. While there are many ways to delineate spaces, one easy way is to go for semi-closed partitions that won\u2019t obstruct the openness of your place and yet create a visual boundary between areas. There are several partition elements that you can try. However, the most purposeful way of utilising the partition is by using a multipurpose partition design, as shown. The metallic partition piece is actually an open shelf unit that can help you display your artefacts, photo frames and indoor plants while delineating your open layout. You can use this type of shelf-cum-partition unit for studio apartments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"940\" height=\"564\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/31164725\/room-partition-cum-display-unit-multi-purpose-furniture.jpg\" alt=\"A room partition with open shelf space multi-purpose furniture design creating an airy interior design for the area.\" class=\"wp-image-22384\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/31164725\/room-partition-cum-display-unit-multi-purpose-furniture.jpg 940w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/31164725\/room-partition-cum-display-unit-multi-purpose-furniture-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/31164725\/room-partition-cum-display-unit-multi-purpose-furniture-768x461.jpg 768w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/31164725\/room-partition-cum-display-unit-multi-purpose-furniture-150x90.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" \/><figcaption>A multipurpose room divider design element with open shelf space<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Wardrobe That Comes With A Study And A Bed<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Why invest in an old fashioned TV unit when you can have a piece of multipurpose furniture with modern TV units?
