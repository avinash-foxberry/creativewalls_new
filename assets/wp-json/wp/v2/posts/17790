We also managed to adapt to the new normal, managed to forget our old griefs and took baby steps towards a safe and secured future. The year has taught us the importance of life, friendship, family and most importantly recreated the attachment with our homes. We have seen our homes turned into our workplaces, classrooms, recreation spots, entertainment hubs and an occasional party zone.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the year draws to a close, and most of us are vaccinated, we would like to see it off in style with festive <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/blog\/home-decor\/new-year-decoration-ideas\/\">new year decoration ideas<\/a>. But restrictions on venues and guidelines on social distancing mean welcoming the new year while partying hard is definitely out of the question.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is that it\u2019s still possible to celebrate New Year\u2019s Eve responsibly with fun new year decorations at home. The trick is to have a small gathering at home with a limited number of guests and avoid crowded places.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Move the party to your backyard festooned with new year decorations. However, if that\u2019s not possible, choose a room that is well ventilated.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though the severity of COVID has mellowed with time, but it\u2019s not gone yet. So, make sure that your guests are wearing their masks during the party.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will also be a good idea to place bottles of hand sanitiser at various locations in the room along with your new year decoration. Keep extra masks at hand to give to those of your guests who may have forgotten to get theirs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also recommend that you ensure social distancing during the party by marking spots for guests to stand or sit. Ensure that the people at the party are seated at least six feet apart while they are eating, appreciating the new year decoration or watching the countdown to 2022.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In case you were wondering what changes you should make to your home as part of new year party decoration, we have your back. In this blog post, we have detailed the layout of prominent hangout spots in your house. Plan where your guests should be beforehand to ensure social distancing and a safe party.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The living room, all brightened up with new year party decorations, can be the hotspot for your party. Furniture and new year party decorations can be arranged in a way that five-six people can easily be accommodated.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"mbgc-slide-caption\"><a href=\"#contactUsModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Lets plan your home interiors together, speak to designers now\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/28124401\/lets-plan-home-interiors-together.jpg \" \/><\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Lobby Decked Up With New Year Decoration<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The lobby \u2014 done up with new year decoration at home \u2014 is where you will receive your guests. It\u2019s a good place to keep extra masks and hand sanitiser handy so that your friends and family coming to the party can easily take precautions before even entering the crowded area. You can add party hats to get everyone in a jovial mood. You can do up the lobby decor with new year decoration so that your guests feel welcome and comfortable. Hooks are great for hanging coats of those coming to the party. A lobby is a perfect place to set the mood of the party.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"940\" height=\"564\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/22172533\/lobby-new-year-room-decoration.jpg\" alt=\"Lobby new year decoration 2022 images, keep masks and hand sanitiser for safety and add party hats to get everyone in a cheerful mood.\" class=\"wp-image-17795\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/22172533\/lobby-new-year-room-decoration.jpg 940w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/22172533\/lobby-new-year-room-decoration-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/22172533\/lobby-new-year-room-decoration-768x461.jpg 768w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/22172533\/lobby-new-year-room-decoration-150x90.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" \/><figcaption>Give a warm welcome to your party guests by doing up your lobby with funky decor<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Backyard As A New Year\u2019s Eve Party Spot<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The backyard can be the perfect setting for your New Year\u2019s Eve bash. It is also a safer place to host a party as there won\u2019t be an issue with ventilation and can be where you implement your new year party decoration ideas. May we suggest a barbeque for the party. The grill can be at one corner so guests can go and pick up snacks without crowding the space and maintaining a safe distance from each other. You can have your guests seated around a table stacked with food at the centre of the backyard from where guests can serve themselves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Near the seating area we can have a bar unit. The bar countertop might have beverages, finger snacks and disposable plates and glasses for guests. To keep the backyard clean, a dustbin can be placed in the corner. Guests can help clear up by throwing used disposable glasses and plates in the bin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The backyard can be decorated with fairy lights and lanterns for an attractive new year decoration. A banner welcoming the new year can be placed where guests can see.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"940\" height=\"564\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/21170711\/happy-new-year-decoration-in-backyard.jpg\" alt=\"New year party decorations in the backyard with barbeque and a small bar unit at home is a safer and fantastic spot\" class=\"wp-image-29229\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/21170711\/happy-new-year-decoration-in-backyard.jpg 940w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/21170711\/happy-new-year-decoration-in-backyard-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/21170711\/happy-new-year-decoration-in-backyard-768x461.jpg 768w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/21170711\/happy-new-year-decoration-in-backyard-150x90.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" \/><figcaption>The backyard of a house can be a fantastic spot for a party and will be safer to<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Dinner Table Adorned With New Year Party Decoration 2022<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The question of how to seat your guests at the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/blog\/dining-room-interiors\/dining-table-designs\/\">dinner table<\/a> assumes significance in a pandemic year. It is advisable to use a long table to serve your guests. This way, they can be seated comfortably and at a distance from each other, where they can appreciate the new year party decorations. You can make floral arrangements at the dinner table as an iconic new year decoration for your party. As more new year party decorations, you can have a banner, balloons, streamers and other items.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"940\" height=\"564\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/21170717\/new-year-decoration-at-home-for-dining-area.jpg\" alt=\"New year party decoration ideas for the dining room with a long table, balloons and streamers are perfect during the pandemic\" class=\"wp-image-29230\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/21170717\/new-year-decoration-at-home-for-dining-area.jpg 940w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/21170717\/new-year-decoration-at-home-for-dining-area-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/21170717\/new-year-decoration-at-home-for-dining-area-768x461.jpg 768w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/21170717\/new-year-decoration-at-home-for-dining-area-150x90.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" \/><figcaption>A long table is perfect for dinner during a pandemic year<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Home Bar In The Balcony<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In case you don\u2019t have a backyard, you can set up a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/blog\/home-interiors\/home-bar-design-ideas\/\">home bar<\/a> in the balcony and bedeck it with happy new year decorations. This is a brilliant way to avoid crowding in the living room. The bar, in addition to being stocked with every kind of alcohol, can have four bar stools placed at a distance from each other. The bar countertop can have containers of hand sanitiser to enable easy access for friends and family attending your party. The balcony can have origami stars, scented candles and lanterns as new year party decorations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"940\" height=\"564\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/21170723\/new-year-party-decoration-in-balcony-with-home-bar.jpg\" alt=\"New year decoration ideas for home balcony with bar unit and counter are perfect and safer celebration at home\" class=\"wp-image-29231\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/21170723\/new-year-party-decoration-in-balcony-with-home-bar.jpg 940w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/21170723\/new-year-party-decoration-in-balcony-with-home-bar-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/21170723\/new-year-party-decoration-in-balcony-with-home-bar-768x461.jpg 768w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/21170723\/new-year-party-decoration-in-balcony-with-home-bar-150x90.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" \/><figcaption>Take the party to your balcony and set up a home bar there<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To ensure that your party is a success, you can do a \u2018rehearsal\u2019.
