Troubled by the thought of landing a south-east-facing house? Here are a few south-east-facing house Vastu tips that can see you through<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several out there who believe that south-east-facing homes or plots bring in negativity and bad energies. According to Vastu Shastra, there are no bad directions. It is just that some energies and circumstances do not favour you when your house faces a particular direction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, not everyone has the option of building a house from scratch where they plan the directions according to the south-east facing house Vastu plan. What if you are frantically looking for a home to buy or rent and you have no other option other than a south-east-facing one? You finalise the deal and take the necessary steps following Vastu Shastra and channelise the energies to bring in prosperity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few Vastu Shastra tips that can help you reside in your new home in peace.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Position The Kitchen Well<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you own a house that faces the south-east direction, ensure that you have the kitchen in the north-west. South-east Vastu states that the energies coming in from that direction infuses better nutrition while taming the Fire God.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to experts helping out with south-east-facing house Vastu tips, when you have a home that faces the south-east, avoid keeping open space in front of the house. Occupy it with a parking area or grow trees to block negative energies coming into your home. There shouldn\u2019t be any free flow coming through the main door or windows that face the south-east direction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"940\" height=\"564\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/23124354\/position-the-kitchen-well-as-per-south-east-entrance-vastu.jpg\" alt=\"Position the kitchen well for south east entrance house vastu\" class=\"wp-image-22895\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/23124354\/position-the-kitchen-well-as-per-south-east-entrance-vastu.jpg 940w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/23124354\/position-the-kitchen-well-as-per-south-east-entrance-vastu-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/23124354\/position-the-kitchen-well-as-per-south-east-entrance-vastu-768x461.jpg 768w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/23124354\/position-the-kitchen-well-as-per-south-east-entrance-vastu-150x90.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" \/><figcaption>The kitchen is where you cook meals.

Ensure that the living room is towards the east. Good vibes and energies flow in from that direction to allow peace and harmony to prevail. Any other side may not be favourable while causing frequent fights and disputes among the family members.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to the negative energies flowing in from the south-east direction, it is said that the women in the house tend to face heath problems. To curb this, paint the main door facing south-east red both from the inside and the outside. Painting the entrance door red prevents the negative energy from coming in and having a significant impact on your family members.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"940\" height=\"564\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/23125419\/check-the-living-room-of-south-east-facing-house-vastu.jpg\" alt=\"south east facing house vastu- check the living room with sound energy\" class=\"wp-image-22896\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/23125419\/check-the-living-room-of-south-east-facing-house-vastu.jpg 940w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/23125419\/check-the-living-room-of-south-east-facing-house-vastu-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/23125419\/check-the-living-room-of-south-east-facing-house-vastu-768x461.jpg 768w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/23125419\/check-the-living-room-of-south-east-facing-house-vastu-150x90.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" \/><figcaption>With a lot of activity taking place here, sound energy is required to keep the room lively<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, read more about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/blog\/living-room-interiors\/vastu-colors-living-room\/\">Vastu Colours for Living Room<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Use Red Curtains At The Entrance<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are times when you cannot do anything about the south-east-facing home that you live in. That is when you can use little tricks to curb negative energies from flowing in. Put up red curtains or of a different dark shade. They hold up the bad energies and prevent them from coming in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bedroom is where you rest at the end of the day while getting rid of worries and negativity coming in from various sources. That is why you should ensure that it is in the south-west direction. If that isn\u2019t possible, ensure that the bed faces the south-east. Leave a gap between the bed and the wall to channelise the energies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"940\" height=\"564\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/23125716\/use-red-curtains-at-the-entrance-if-you-go-for-south-east-facing-house-vastu-plan.jpg\" alt=\"South east facing house vastu plan if you go for red curtains which pushes negative energy out\" class=\"wp-image-22897\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/23125716\/use-red-curtains-at-the-entrance-if-you-go-for-south-east-facing-house-vastu-plan.jpg 940w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/23125716\/use-red-curtains-at-the-entrance-if-you-go-for-south-east-facing-house-vastu-plan-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/23125716\/use-red-curtains-at-the-entrance-if-you-go-for-south-east-facing-house-vastu-plan-768x461.jpg 768w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/23125716\/use-red-curtains-at-the-entrance-if-you-go-for-south-east-facing-house-vastu-plan-150x90.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" \/><figcaption>Red curtains not just look great but also ward off negative energies from coming in<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"mbgc-slide-caption\"><a href=\"#contactUsModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Lets plan your home interiors together, speak to designers now\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/28124401\/lets-plan-home-interiors-together.jpg \" \/><\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Paint The South-East Wall Red<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This direction brings in power, activity and good energy, which is why experts providing south-east entrance Vastu remedies suggest painting the wall red. If you do not like the colour, try opting for a different shade, but it should be dark. The walls hold up the good energy while keeping your house at peace.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Toilets shouldn\u2019t be constructed in the south-west direction. It leads to an imbalance in the energy flow. If there is a toilet that already exists in that direction and nothing can be done about it, keep the doors closed all the time. Also, ensure that the bathroom doesn\u2019t face the kitchen. If it does, close both doors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"940\" height=\"564\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/23131435\/paint-the-south-east-wall-red-for-south-east-vastu.jpg\" alt=\"Paint south east wall red for south east vastu to control positive energy\" class=\"wp-image-22898\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/23131435\/paint-the-south-east-wall-red-for-south-east-vastu.jpg 940w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/23131435\/paint-the-south-east-wall-red-for-south-east-vastu-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/23131435\/paint-the-south-east-wall-red-for-south-east-vastu-768x461.jpg 768w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/23131435\/paint-the-south-east-wall-red-for-south-east-vastu-150x90.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" \/><figcaption>Painting the south-eastern wall red allows the control of positive energy<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">General Vastu Tips For A Happy Home<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Keep the entrance area clean all the time. Place plants alongside and decorate it well to attract wealth and prosperity.<\/li><li>The cupboard or the cash locker should open to the north direction to attract energies.<\/li><li>Avoid leaving taps open in the kitchen or bathroom.
