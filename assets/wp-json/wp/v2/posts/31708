But many people often hesitate to take on the mammoth task of remodelling their kitchen due to the exorbitant cost and time involved. Especially if the road to perfection requires a complete overhaul of the space. However, a successful transformation can do wonders for your home&#8217;s value. Whether you need a minor refresh or a gut renovation, the best place to start is with inspiration. Check out how our designers at DesignCafe gave outdated kitchens a dream makeover for our clients. Here are 7 spectacular before and after kitchen remodel examples to find your inspiration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Before After Kitchen Remodel That Declutters With Built-in Appliance Units<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This dated kitchen in Mr Mahesh Yadav\u2019s apartment in Mumbai lacked function and style until our expert team from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/\">DesignCafe<\/a> intervened. The carpenter-made cabinets were in a bad state. Mr Mahesh visited our experience centre and selected a beige and white modular kitchen unit. He also needed built-in storage space for the oven and microwave. But being a Mumbai apartment, it didn\u2019t offer much space for movement. Our designers customised the modular kitchen unit, complete with seamless push and pull sleek cabinets made of acrylic finish plywood. The brand new kitchen also has a built-in space for a dishwasher.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"mbgc-slide-caption\"><a href=\"#contactUsModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Modular kitchen solutions for indian homes with 20% extra storage\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/15143644\/modular-kitchen-solutions-for-indian-homes-with-20-extra-storage.jpg \" \/><\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Before After Kitchen Remodel Featuring Intelligent Pull-out Cabinet Systems<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The owners of this kitchen had many items that they needed to store away. They requested our designers for a smart solution to maximise the storage space in their kitchen. DesignCafe\u2019s experts breathed new life into this dilapidated kitchen with our space-enhancing modular kitchen units. We installed features like a magic pull-out unit, spice pull-out and tandem drawers. We also custom-made a designated area for the refrigerator and placed open shelves above it to store extra crockery. We also changed the countertop to quartz and installed designer ceramic tiles. The owners were ecstatic to see how much open space the new modular L-shaped unit had created in their kitchen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cheap Kitchen Remodel Before And After For Those On A Budget<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/blog\/modular-kitchen-interiors\/parallel-kitchen-designs-home\/\">parallel kitchen<\/a> had a narrow but long moving space. With a dual countertop, the home owners, Mr Rohan Jaju and his family, had ample working space. But it needed some remodelling to look modern. Mr Jaju selected our blue modular kitchen unit with a tall pull-out pantry. For the wall units, Mr Jaju went for white veneer finish laminates which matched well with the newly installed white ceramic tiles as backsplash. The new layout is much cleaner with parallel countertops. Since it is a separate room, it\u2019s easier for the family to stow away kitchen items from the remainder of the house.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Kitchen Model Before And After To Rework The Colour Scheme<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The partition wall that separated this kitchen from the utility area made the space feel more cramped than necessary. When Mr Pandurang Nayak and his family moved to this apartment, they quickly realised it needed a complete overhaul. The original backsplash featuring black tiles was making the kitchen appear more compact than it already was. The water tub in front of the sink shrunk the space even further. We removed the black tiles and installed multi-coloured mosaic pattern ones. The owners went for a veneer finish for the bottom cabinets, whereas they chose dark grey laminate for the top cabinets. We also installed a modern, sleek chimney and black marble as a countertop.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Transform Boring to Cheery With This Before After Kitchen Remodel&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The owner of this kitchen is a millennial living with her partner. The home is a studio apartment. So, the small straight kitchen is their best option to keep the space open and airy. The couple wanted to renovate their kitchen while redoing their whole flat. The couple seldom cooks at home. So, their storage requirement was minimal. Previously, the kitchen didn\u2019t have any shutters on the kitchen cabinets. They didn\u2019t have much space to work on. We installed our studio kitchen unit with a few internal drawers, tandem drawers and a spice rack. The bottom drawers were made of BWP (boiling waterproof) ply with a veneer finish, while the wall cabinets had a lacquer finish. The combination of wooden brown and glossy pink cabinets with an off-white quartz countertop and beige backsplash against the midnight-blue wall tiles made the kitchen look Instagram-worthy. We also replaced the old two-burner hob with a stylish seamless four-burner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Cheap Kitchen Remodel Before And After For A Bespoke Upgrade<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This kitchen proves that you don\u2019t need ample space to have a stunning place to cook in. The kitchen is built on one corner in this vast space, leaving a large area for a breakfast nook. But the features it lacks are natural light and some style. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/blog\/modular-kitchen-interiors\/l-shape-kitchen-indian-home\/\">L-shaped kitchen<\/a> needed modernisation as the present owners bought a 30-year-old house. Our experts at DesignCafe redid this L-shaped civil kitchen from scratch. We installed new tiles with floral patterns as the backsplash. The colour scheme we chose for this kitchen was beige drawers with top cabinets in a darker shade of cyan. We also used frosted glass cabinets to break the monotony of top cabinets in the same colour. We equipped the kitchen with functional elements like tandem drawers, tandem 50KG drawer, spice rack, open box wall units, under sink units and a skirting drawer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"mbgc-slide-caption\"><a href=\"#contactUsModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Get a kitchen that's perfect for your dream home\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/27172636\/get-kitchen-that-perfect-like-you.jpg \" \/><\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This Old-School G-shaped Kitchen Gets A Dreamy Makeover<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The old kitchen was civil and made with off-white ply. Though in a pleasant state, the kitchen needed some life breathed into it. And, we did just that. Our designers at DesignCafe customised this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/blog\/modular-kitchen-interiors\/g-shaped-kitchen-design\/\">G-shaped kitchen<\/a> that was separated by a door leading to the utility area. We kept the cooking area and cleaning area separate. We installed our various signature pull-out drawers and cabinets along with a tall pull-out pantry. We also equipped the kitchen with two built-in spaces for the microwave and oven. We used up the entire soffit and installed storage cabinets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>How did you like these before after kitchen remodel ideas?
