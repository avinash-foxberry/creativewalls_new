Find Out Here"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>Everything you need to know about kid\u2019s room interior design which is perfect for your first child.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Home is where your heart lies. It is a place where you spend most of your life\u2019s personal moments. With every big step in your life, you try to change some of your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/interior-design\/\">home interiors<\/a> to fit with your present lifestyle. For example, a bachelor&#8217;s pad is much different from a working couple\u2019s home or a joint family. But the concept of home interiors changes totally when you start planning for your first kid. Gone are the days when <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/blog\/kids-bedroom-interiors\/kids-bedroom-furniture-ideas\/\">kid\u2019s bedroom furniture<\/a> was all about adding a small cradle in the corner of the master bedroom. Home interiors are a lifetime investment and when you are thinking about revamping your home for your first kid, it is crucial to think in advance about your kid\u2019s eventual growing needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a separate space for themselves from a tender age helps kids with their mental and emotional growth too. It teaches them to be confident, take charge of cleaning their space and become responsible. These values are quite important, especially for kids of today&#8217;s generation. So, here we have got you some tips and tricks to help you design your first kid\u2019s room that will not only cater to their current needs but their future needs as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Purpose Of A Kid\u2019s Room<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A kid\u2019s room is a multifunctional space where your child can play, sleep and study. It\u2019s also a place they can call their own. As they grow up, the space grows with them. It plays an important role in housing not just their toys and clothes but their imagination, creativity and memories that they can come back to once they are all grown up. So, the interior design of the kid\u2019s room plays a crucial role in building their character and helping them create a space where they feel comfortable and happy. Small details like a spacious and clutter-free room, multifunctional furniture, ample lights and choice of colours go a long way in building the perfect space for your first kid. So, when thinking of building the perfect kid\u2019s room in your home, be mindful of these details and you are good to go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"940\" height=\"564\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/07170511\/kids-room-designed-by-designcafe.jpg\" alt=\"Kids room designed by DesignCafe at bangalore\" class=\"wp-image-38432\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/07170511\/kids-room-designed-by-designcafe.jpg 940w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/07170511\/kids-room-designed-by-designcafe-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/07170511\/kids-room-designed-by-designcafe-768x461.jpg 768w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/07170511\/kids-room-designed-by-designcafe-150x90.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">A kid\u2019s room at Ele Vana, Bangalore by DesignCafe<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"mbgc-slide-caption\"><a href=\"#contactUsModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Want a playful kid's room for your munchkin\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/09111815\/want-a-playful-kids-room-for-your-munchkin.jpg \" \/><\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Essential Furniture For A Kid\u2019s Bedroom<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you start <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/interior-design\/kids-bedroom-design\/\">designing your kid\u2019s bedroom<\/a>, here are a few pieces of furniture you should never forget to include. But make sure to leave ample floor space so your kids can play around freely, especially during their early days.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A Comfortable Bed: <\/strong>Good sleep is essential for your child\u2019s development. So make sure to add a comfortable bed where they can rest peacefully. You can opt for a bed with hidden storage space to house their toys, clothes and other knick-knacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A Functional Wardrobe:<\/strong> A functional wardrobe is crucial in keeping all your kid\u2019s clothes, toys, books and other knick-knacks. It helps in keeping your kid\u2019s room tidy and saves ample floor space too.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A Study Corner: <\/strong>Though having a study corner at an early age might seem unnecessary, but trust us, time flies and you will not realise when your child has started going to play school. The initial few years go by in a jiffy. But still, if you don&#8217;t want to occupy the space with a full-fledged study corner right now, choose a wardrobe with a study pull-out. This is a sustainable and space-saving option. These won&#8217;t take up any extra space, yet keep you ready way ahead of time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Window Bay Seater With Storage: <\/strong>A window bay seater is an excellent addition to your kid\u2019s bedroom. You can sit with them here and enjoy the outside view. Add some drawers beneath so you get extra storage space for their diapers, towels, clothes and other essentials.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Kid-Friendly Colour Options For The Bedroom<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Colours have a huge impact on livening up home interiors. You can add some vibrant colours to your kid\u2019s room for a joyous vibe, add a thematic wallpaper or choose pastel shades and accentuate it with a pop of colour. Here are a few options for you:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Choose Vibrant Colours:<\/strong> Brighten up your kid\u2019s room with some vibrant colour schemes. You can choose a single pastel colour or play with different shades to create the beautiful kid&#8217;s room of their dreams.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eco-Friendly Washable Colours:<\/strong> It is very important to choose eco-friendly paint when you have kids around. These are safe for your kids and easy to maintain. Even if they mess up the walls, just wipe it with a sponge and a mild soap solution and you will be good to go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Go For Chalkboard Paint:<\/strong> If cleaning the walls regularly seems too tiring for you, go for chalkboard paint for a section of the walls. This will give your kid a dedicated space to explore their doodling skills and make learning fun while saving your walls from the unnecessary mess.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thematic Wallpaper:<\/strong> If you want thematic interiors for your kid\u2019s room, wallpaper can add a lot of value to the design. These are easy to install and comparatively cheaper than wall paint. But be mindful to treat the corners well to avoid ugly peel-offs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Safety Measures To Keep In Mind For A Kid\u2019s Bedroom\u2019s Interior Design<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Homes with kids around need thoughtfully-designed smart modular furniture that helps create a safe environment for your kids to play around. It should also be easy to clean and maintain to make your life hassle-free. So, here are a few tips for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Round And Curved Corners:<\/strong> Avoid sharp edges as they might hurt your kid while moving around. Rather, opt for round tables and curved corners. This lends a seamless look and takes care of safety.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Choose Cushioned Upholstery:<\/strong> You can go for cushion upholstery to double up the safety of your kid\u2019s bedroom. You can choose a winged accent chair to protect your kids from walling off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Furniture With Storage<\/strong>: Make sure the sofa, ottoman, bed and other furniture have concealed storage. This will help to arrange all your kid\u2019s toys, clothes, diapers and other essentials in a clutter-free manner while making your home look neat and tidy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Wall-Mounted Bookshelf:<\/strong> Avoid a free-standing bookshelf when you have kids at home. Your kid can try to pull something out of the bookshelf and hurt themselves in the process. So, it is better to have a wall-mounted bookshelf so you can keep your books, artefacts and potted plants out of the reach of your little one. This will also free up the floor space for your kid to play around.

So, having home interiors that will sustain you through the growing age of your child is a must. While designing your kid\u2019s room, make sure to incorporate elements that may not be needed immediately but in due course of time. This way, you can be prepared for what&#8217;s coming in the future. Here are a few tips that will help you plan a sustainable kid\u2019s room for your first child.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ample Storage Options:<\/strong> Your kid\u2019s room needs a lot of storage options so you must go with furniture that has ample storage space. A functional wardrobe, multiple drawers, a side cabinet with storage and a window bay seater with storage will go a long way. As your kid grows, the need for extra storage space will grow exponentially, so having functional furniture with storage units is a must for your kid&#8217;s room.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>An Activity Corner<\/strong>: Physical activity is essential for your kid&#8217;s mental and physical health. So, adding an activity corner plays a crucial part in the interiors of your kid\u2019s room. Though they might not use it right now, this corner will create inquisitiveness in their mind. And once they grow up a little, you can slowly assist them in using it. This way, you will inculcate some healthy habits in your kids from a tender age and also create a nice bond with your little one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A Sturdy Bed: <\/strong>Every kid&#8217;s room needs a bed where they can sleep comfortably and this need never changes even when they&#8217;re all grown up. So, invest in a comfortable bed that will help them have their resting time and wake up fresh and energetic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>We hope this blog answers all your questions about designing the perfect kid\u2019s room for your first baby.
