It\u2019s definitely worth the investment! Skim through our quick room-by-room guide to reduce any kind of uncertainties in your life.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vastu shastra (the science of architecture) suggests that each place in a house has certain energy vibrations associated with it. The primary purpose of this science is to enhance the positive vibrations and deflect the negative vibrations in those spaces. If you\u2019re interested in the subject, you might already know that a North-facing house is the best option and an East-facing house is a second-best option.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the main question is how do you exactly define what\u2019s an east-facing house plan? Well, it&#8217;s pretty easy. <em>If you face the east direction while exiting your house from the main entrance door<\/em> then you have an east-facing house. You can also use a magnetic compass to confirm the actual east direction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some of the benefits of an east-facing house:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>It brings in more luck and gold fortune to homeowners<\/li><li>It brings in more auspiciousness, progress and harmony in your homes<\/li><li>It brings in more focus, agility, development and creativity in all your endeavours<\/li><li>It signifies new beginnings in life since the Sun god also rises from the east.&nbsp;<\/li><li>It provides a well-balanced home environment for you and your family<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>However, just having an east-facing house plan doesn\u2019t itself guarantee that you\u2019ll receive all of its benefits in full force. You will also need to follow the room-by-room Vastu principles associated with it. You already know where we\u2019re heading towards so let\u2019s directly get into it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Main Door Vastu Tips For Your Home<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure that your main entrance is exactly in the middle and not in the north-east or south-east directions when purchasing an east-facing property. A misaligned main entrance is considered highly unlucky and inauspicious for you and your family members. Also, keep your home entrance a few steps above the ground and use high-quality wood for constructing the main door. If you have the slightest doubt then don\u2019t hesitate to contact a Vastu Shastra expert for the same. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"940\" height=\"564\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/17162440\/main-door-vastu-for-east-facing-house.jpg\" alt=\"Precisely in the middle main door Vastu for east facing house is considered highly lucky and auspicious\" class=\"wp-image-16292\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/17162440\/main-door-vastu-for-east-facing-house.jpg 940w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/17162440\/main-door-vastu-for-east-facing-house-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/17162440\/main-door-vastu-for-east-facing-house-768x461.jpg 768w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/17162440\/main-door-vastu-for-east-facing-house-150x90.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bedroom Vastu Tips For Your Home<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t design any kind of bedroom in the north-east or south-east direction. It is believed that <em>Agni<\/em> (Lord of Fire) resides in the south-east that can lead to fights between couples. However, you can construct the master bedroom in the south-west, and the guest room in the north-west. The kid\u2019s room can be placed in the north direction. The ideal placement of the bedroom can lead to a lot of prosperity, good health and sharp intellect for its homeowners.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure you don\u2019t keep any plants or television within close distance from your bed. Mirrors also shouldn\u2019t be placed in front of your bed as reflections of one\u2019s sleeping body isn\u2019t considered auspicious. Remove any chipped items and also don\u2019t place a temple or pooja place in the bedroom. Sleep with your head facing the south for a good night\u2019s sleep. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"940\" height=\"564\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/17162411\/bedroom-east-facing-house-vastu-tips.jpg\" alt=\"White bedroom bed headboard against a south-facing is Vastu for bedroom in east facing house.\" class=\"wp-image-16287\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/17162411\/bedroom-east-facing-house-vastu-tips.jpg 940w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/17162411\/bedroom-east-facing-house-vastu-tips-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/17162411\/bedroom-east-facing-house-vastu-tips-768x461.jpg 768w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/17162411\/bedroom-east-facing-house-vastu-tips-150x90.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"mbgc-slide-caption\"><a href=\"#contactUsModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Get a Free Modular Kitchen Worth \u20b92 Lakhs with Your Home Interiors.\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/08183703\/designcafe-offer-free-modular-kitchen-worth-2-lakhs.jpg \" \/><\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Kitchen Vastu For Your Home<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the kitchen is a holy space where we prepare our daily meals, plan it in the north-west or south-east direction for increased peace of mind. Placing the kitchen in the north-east or south-west can lead to unnecessary expenditures and tension between family members. Within a Vastu-compliant kitchen, place slabs, shelves, fridge and heavier appliances in the west or south. Also, your stove should be facing east in a south-east kitchen and west in a north-west kitchen.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"940\" height=\"564\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/17162423\/east-facing-house-kitchen-vastu.jpg\" alt=\"East facing house Vastu kitchen should place it in the north-west or south-east direction for increased peace of mind.\" class=\"wp-image-16289\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/17162423\/east-facing-house-kitchen-vastu.jpg 940w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/17162423\/east-facing-house-kitchen-vastu-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/17162423\/east-facing-house-kitchen-vastu-768x461.jpg 768w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/17162423\/east-facing-house-kitchen-vastu-150x90.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Living Room Vastu For Your Home<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The living room (drawing room) is a space where you entertain your guests and spend time with your family so design it in the north-east corner of your house. This location brings in positive vibes into space. However, make sure that you don\u2019t have to cross the kitchen or bedroom before entering it. And when it comes to the seating arrangement the owner should always face the north or east side only. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"940\" height=\"564\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/17162434\/living-room-vastu-house-plans-east-facing-house.jpg\" alt=\"This living room in the north-east corner brings in positive vibes and is east facing house Vastu for the living room.\" class=\"wp-image-16291\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/17162434\/living-room-vastu-house-plans-east-facing-house.jpg 940w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/17162434\/living-room-vastu-house-plans-east-facing-house-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/17162434\/living-room-vastu-house-plans-east-facing-house-768x461.jpg 768w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/17162434\/living-room-vastu-house-plans-east-facing-house-150x90.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Dining Room Vastu<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The dining room is a space where the family ideally eats their meal together. So, it should also be carefully placed within the house, best if it&#8217;s nearer to the kitchen on the same floor. In simpler words, it can be located either in the north-west or south-east corner. Avoid the other directions as it can lead to ill-health, stomach disorders and financial problems for the homeowners. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While eating, the head of the family should sit facing the east and others around him but no one should face the south. The dining table should be rectangular or square and not in any other odd shape. You can also put pictures of nature in the dining room to bring vibrancy and positive vibrations into space. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"940\" height=\"564\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/17162417\/dining-room-east-facing-house-plan-as-per-vastu.jpg\" alt=\"The dining room should locate either in the north-west or south-east corner in the east facing house plan as per Vastu.\" class=\"wp-image-16288\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/17162417\/dining-room-east-facing-house-plan-as-per-vastu.jpg 940w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/17162417\/dining-room-east-facing-house-plan-as-per-vastu-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/17162417\/dining-room-east-facing-house-plan-as-per-vastu-768x461.jpg 768w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/17162417\/dining-room-east-facing-house-plan-as-per-vastu-150x90.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pooja Room Vastu<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The north-east direction is regarded as the esha corner, which also means a pure and sacred space. So, it is the ideal location for designing the pooja room (prayer room). It can also be planned in the east or north direction. Make sure it is located on the ground floor only and not attached to any bathroom walls in any case.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vastu tips for the pooja room decor arrangement are:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(1) Keep it clean every day and equipped with only pooja-related items&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(2) Decorate the room with images or idol of Ganesh and other auspicious symbols like Om&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(3) Bathe the gods at least once in a week and place Tulsi plant within your home premises&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(4) The person performing pooja rituals must face towards the north or east while worshipping the god<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"940\" height=\"564\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/17162446\/pooja-room-vastu-for-east-facing-house.jpg\" alt=\"The pooja room in the north-east direction is pure and sacred space is the pooja room Vastu for east facing  the house.\" class=\"wp-image-16293\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/17162446\/pooja-room-vastu-for-east-facing-house.jpg 940w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/17162446\/pooja-room-vastu-for-east-facing-house-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/17162446\/pooja-room-vastu-for-east-facing-house-768x461.jpg 768w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/17162446\/pooja-room-vastu-for-east-facing-house-150x90.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bathroom Vastu<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A bathroom is a space that is meant for cleansing activities. As per the Vastu experts, you can construct a bathroom in the east and west direction. However, ensure that there are windows in your bathroom for proper ventilation and the sunlight to enter as it is good for health. The floor of the bathroom must be sloped towards the east or north for water drainage. Avoid building the bathroom door in the south-west direction. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"940\" height=\"564\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/17162406\/bathroom-toilet-vastu-for-east-facing-house.jpg\" alt=\"Bathroom constructed in east and west direction considered good for health is Vastu house plans east facing house.\" class=\"wp-image-16286\" srcset=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/17162406\/bathroom-toilet-vastu-for-east-facing-house.jpg 940w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/17162406\/bathroom-toilet-vastu-for-east-facing-house-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/17162406\/bathroom-toilet-vastu-for-east-facing-house-768x461.jpg 768w, https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/17162406\/bathroom-toilet-vastu-for-east-facing-house-150x90.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"mbgc-slide-caption\"><a href=\"#contactUsModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Lets plan your home interiors together, speak to designers now\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/28124401\/lets-plan-home-interiors-together.jpg \" \/><\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Staircase Vastu<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As per Vastu guidelines for East-facing houses, the staircase should be constructed in the south-east or north-west corner of the house. It should rise from the north to the south or east to the west (read: turn in a clockwise direction always). Ensure that the staircase doesn\u2019t have any room under it and that the number of steps is always odd including the landing area as well.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hang on my friend!
