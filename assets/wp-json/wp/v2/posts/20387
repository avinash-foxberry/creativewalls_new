And since there is a multitude of choices available in the market today, we\u2019ve rounded up some of the most trending wine rack design images that best fit your needs. Read further to find out<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A wine rack is an essential piece of furniture and decor in a home that\u2019s full of wine lovers. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re growing your existing collection or just entering the world of wines, a wine rack can become your saviour by giving your bottles and glasses a good place to rest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we get into the crux of the blog post, let\u2019s address some FAQs for prospective wine rack buyers so that some of their doubts\/concerns are laid to rest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Are The Benefits Of Using A Wine Rack?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>It facilitates the organised storage of your wine bottles in a single location, whether they\u2019re 10 or 100.<\/li><li>It is space-saving and can be accommodated in any corner\/surface of the house depending upon the design chosen.&nbsp;<\/li><li>It is durable and strong since most of the wine racks are made of wood, metal, wrought iron and tough glass.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/li><li>It is versatile (customised designs and sizes) and quite affordable as compared to designing a whole wine cellar.&nbsp;<\/li><li>It offers great aesthetic appeal to the room and can become a focal point\/conversation starter.&nbsp;<\/li><li>It helps in the proper positioning and conditioning of the wine bottles so that they mature well over time, and preserves their quality and flavour. How?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"mbgc-slide-caption\"><a href=\"#contactUsModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Get a Free Modular Kitchen Worth \u20b92 Lakhs with Your Home Interiors.\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/08183703\/designcafe-offer-free-modular-kitchen-worth-2-lakhs.jpg \" \/><\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>It allows for better temperature control (~50-60 degrees Fahrenheit) and balanced humidity (~60-70%).&nbsp;<\/li><li>It keeps the cork wet and does not let it crumble\/dry out.&nbsp;<\/li><li>It makes it easier to evenly turn it as the wine bottle is horizontally placed.&nbsp;<\/li><li>It reduces the amount of direct and bright light hitting the bottles (because they require low lighting).<\/li><li>It helps you easily identify the bottles without having to move them much.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Are The Average Dimensions of A Wine Rack?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ideally, the average wine rack design dimensions are based on those of a standard wine bottle. So, if the wine bottle has a standard diameter of 3-3.2 inches and a height of 12 inches, then the wine rack\u2019s depth should be at least 15 inches to store the wine bottle in a completely horizontal position. However, the exact dimensions of a wine rack may also vary according to the final design chosen (without or without shelves, glass holder and bar pull-out).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A quick note on how to build your own traditional wood wine rack:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Measure the width and height of the location where you want to place the wine rack<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Cut out the wood panels according to the dimensions taken and sand them to remove any unevenness on their surfaces<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Assemble and interlock the wood panels together with wood glue or nail gun<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. Paint the wine rack (if you want) and let it dry thoroughly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Much Does A Wine Rack Cost?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wood-based wine rack designs are priced on the higher end as wood is an expensive material and comes in multiple finishes. Also, wine racks that include extra features (wine glass storage, extra drawers and cabinets for accessories) and are more stylish will cost more.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some estimates for certain wine rack designs for your reference:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>A normal tall glass shutter unit with internal glass shelves to store wine bottles and glasses \u2014 2 ft. (width) x 7 ft. (height) x 1.5 ft. (depth) \u2014 will cost you from Rs 34,000-35,000 (without GST).<\/li><li>A small open-box wine rack design with criss-cross shelves \u2014 2 ft. (width) x 3 ft. (height) x 2 ft. (depth) \u2014 will cost you from Rs 15,000-16,000 (without GST). If you want to add a wine glass holder below it, then the holder will cost you another Rs 350.&nbsp;<\/li><li>A wine rack design with a bar pull-out concept to store around four-six wine glasses, three-four bottles and a few knickknacks will cost you Rs 32,000&nbsp; (without GST). This is applicable for the high-gloss and normal laminate variety and also comes with a heavy-duty channel. <\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Are The Different Types Of Wine Racks Designs Available And Their USPs?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Wall-Mounted Wine Rack:<\/strong> It is directly mounted onto the wall, thereby saving floor space. Sometimes, it also finds a place between two wall-mounted kitchen cabinets. It allows expansion of the wine rack later but not too much (between six and 20 bottles).&nbsp; However, it is difficult to transport in case one relocates.<\/li><li><strong>Stackable Wine Rack:<\/strong> It is perfect for those who want to start small with minimal storage space but are flexible as you can keep adding more layers and expanding it as your wine collection grows. No installation is required as such and minimal building is involved. It is cost-effective too.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Freestanding\/Floor Wine Rack:<\/strong> It is the most economical and popular option among all wine racks. It can accommodate 2-3 or 50-100 bottles depending upon the size chosen. It is much more versatile as you needn\u2019t worry about the height and weight of the wine rack.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Countertop\/Tabletop Wine Rack:<\/strong> It is perfect for people who live in small apartments or homes and holds a maximum of about 2-6 or 15-20 wine bottles depending upon the size. You can place it on the dining table, side table, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/blog\/modular-kitchen-interiors\/kitchen-island-designs-for-home\/\">kitchen island<\/a> or any spare counter space and access it conveniently. However, it is not ideal for long-term storage as kitchen and dining room conditions may vary.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Hanging Wine Rack:<\/strong> It hangs either under a cabinet space or from the ceiling, unlike wall-mounted wine racks. They hold less capacity but look really aesthetic. Some designs also come with additional space for hanging wine glasses too.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Do You Need To Keep In Mind While Choosing The Perfect Wine Rack For Your Home?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several factors to keep in mind while buying a perfect wine rack for your home:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>The budget for your wine collection and its wine rack storage. Ensure that the wine rack design you buy is safe enough and minimises the risk of your bottles falling down.&nbsp;<\/li><li>The total horizontal and vertical space you have in your home and the location to accommodate it.&nbsp;<\/li><li>The possibility of growing\/expanding your wine rack design in the future (for the wine connoisseur or casual collector).<\/li><li>The number of wine bottles (or the volume) you currently have in store.&nbsp;<\/li><li>The dimensions and size of the wine rack design chosen and the extra features you want to add to it.&nbsp;<\/li><li>The desired resting position of the bottles on the wine rack \u2014 horizontal (most preferred), tilted (second-best option) and vertical (least preferred).<\/li><li>The material you want the wine rack design to be made up of \u2014 glass, wood, iron or metal \u2014&nbsp; its durability and the maintenance and care it will require in case the wine bottle is dropped accidentally.&nbsp;<\/li><li>The lighting conditions (dim\/dark lighting), humidity, amount of movement and temperature in the desired location to allow the wines to mature properly.&nbsp;<\/li><li>The difference between racked bottle capacity and bottle capacity.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, let\u2019s check out these amazing wine rack design ideas and take the best pick to adorn your home with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Get Your Home Ready For Fun &amp; Safe House Parties | Home Bar Designs | Dining Room Designs\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/bLCm1LoBdCE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Freestanding Metal Wine Rack Design<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This freestanding metal wine rack design truly looks like a work of art in this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/blog\/modular-kitchen-interiors\/open-kitchen-design\/\">open-kitchen space<\/a>.
