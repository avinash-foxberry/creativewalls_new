And a small section of your wall and floor space where some magic can unfold. Meet the Murphy bed, the miracle wand that you have been waiting for. Also called a wall bed, a fold-up bed or a folding bed, the&nbsp;<strong>Murphy bed<\/strong>&nbsp;is the last word in clever space saving furniture design. Simply put, it is a bed that through the wonders of mechanical engineering can be folded up and stored into the wall. Apart from its space-saving features, Murphy beds bring no end of cool to the room. It converts any room into a guest room with an instant touch of a button and you can design it to give you extra storage. The magic of the Murphy bed is that you can literally rest assured of its comfort and a good night\u2019s sleep.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the original Murphy invented the bed to convert his bedroom into a sitting parlour, today there are multiple ways that you can leverage this design. Use the technology to create a home office, extra seating, and tons of storage. Or you can keep it simple and pared down to just a sleeping solution. Read our guide to find which Murphy bed best meets your needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/04122927\/advantages-of-having-murphy-bed-at-home-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Advantages of having a murphy bed at home\" style=\"aspect-ratio:9\/16;object-fit:contain\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">To Wall Mount Or Not?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You have two options when it comes to installing a Murphy bed, in terms of its mounting. A built-in bed is mounted on the wall such that it is a permanent installation. It is cleverly fixed to the wall giving it stability and making it seemingly disappear into the wall or behind furniture. In the other option, the bed is a free-standing one. These are mobile and can be taken with you if leave the house and wish to carry it to your new home. These are also perfect if you are a tenant whose rent agreement doesn\u2019t allow you to make changes to the wall and the floor, ruling out the possibility of a traditional wall-mounted Murphy Bed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/17055949\/traditional-murphy-bed-for-space-saving-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Wall mounted Murphy bed is innovative bed design which is a collapsible into a wall bed in Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad\" class=\"wp-image-1759\" title=\"Murphy bed is wall mounted bed making it disappear into a wall when not in use \"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">A traditional Murphy bed is wall mounted making it disappear into a wall when not in use<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, check out&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/interior-design\/bedroom-design\/\">Latest Bedroom Interior Designs from DesignCafe<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sit And Sleep In Comfort On This Wall Mounted Murphy Bed<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ever spent a night on a sofa cum bed, tossing and turning trying to find a comfortable spot? If you have the (mis)fortune of doing so, you will know all about waking up with aches and pains and swearing never again. What will surely change your mind is the sofa Murphy bed. In the traditional sofa cum bed, a sofa converts into a bed. In this Murphy bed option, the bed is a separate unit with a sofa as an attachment. The convertible bed folds down over the sofa making the sofa disappear. This option is highly recommended if your living space needs to seat people during the daytime and sleep at night. This multi-purpose bed has an added advantage of being comfortable, saving space and providing cosy and stylish seating.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/17055948\/wall-folding-murphy-bed-for-sit-and-sleep-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Wall mounted bed with sofa is a convertible multipurpose bed and one of the innovative murphy bed designs in Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad\" class=\"wp-image-1760\" title=\"Wall folding murphy bed design transforming sofa into a comfortable bed\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The Murphy Bed folds down over this handsome sofa transforming into a comfortable bed for two<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"mbgc-slide-caption\"><a href=\"#contactUsModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Customise your bed and enjoy up to 25 year warranty\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/08210059\/customise-your-bed-enjoy-up-to-25-year-warranty.jpg \" \/><\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Flip For A Desk, A Murphy Wall Mounted Design For Smart Study<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The flip-up desk wall bed is a boon for those looking to create a working space and solve for temporary sleeping arrangements. At night, the wall bed folds down and becomes a bedding solution while during the day the desk can be flipped up to make a home study. This smart design comes with the additional option of having drawers, cabinets and bookshelves to make it a complete&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/blog\/home-interiors\/home-office-design-ideas\/\">home office design<\/a>. Moreover, the desk can be designed in such a manner, that when not being used, it simply slides under with any contents resting on it intact. Thus saving you the bother of clearing the desk surface when pulling down the bed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/17055947\/murphy-wall-mounted-design-with-drawers-and-pull-out-double-bed-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"A multipurpose Murphy bed that can be folded into a study table, is a multifunctional wall mounted bed at best price in India\" class=\"wp-image-1761\" title=\"The flip up desk wall mounted murphy bed is a multipurpose bed, its folds down and becomes a bedding solution and flipped up to make a home study\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">To convert into a bed, wheel out the chest of drawers and pull the bed open<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Put Up A Show With Shelves And More Beside The Murphy Bed<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The wonderful advantage of a convertible bed like the Murphy bed is that you can integrate display shelves and storage into it. To do so, you can custom design open storage and closed storage around the wall bed. Open storage will make the space look airy and big and some stylishly arranged display pieces will further enliven and brighten the room. Closed storage either in the form of closet shelves or drawers will keep your household items safe and free from dust and prying eyes. Use either closed or open storage or a combination of the two in conjunction with the Murphy bed to utilise the full potential of the space. The storage can be built along one side of the bed frame or on both sides, depending on the dimensions of the space and your storage needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/17055946\/multipurpose-murphy-bed-for-storage-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"A wardrobe cum bed is a multifunctional furniture with a wall mounted pullout bed in Bangalore, Mumbai and Hyderabad\" class=\"wp-image-1762\" title=\"Wall mounted murphy bed design to utilise the full potential of the space, its very useful for space saving in small rooms\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The open display is further enhanced by an elegant yellow and grey colour scheme in this elegant room<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tuck It Away And Be All Tucked In!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If your storage needs warrant it, go the whole hog and install a wardrobe cum bed. The Murphy bed and a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/blog\/bedroom-interiors\/wardrobe-design-for-bedroom\/\">wardrobe for bedroom<\/a>&nbsp;are integrated in such a manner that you get the best of both worlds. When the bed is not in use and folded away, what you will see is an innocuous-looking wardrobe. When open, not only will you have the bed that you need, but you will also have some cleverly hidden wardrobe storage. By utilising the wall panel behind the multipurpose bed as a closet, two birds are snagged using one stone.&nbsp; Moreover, you don\u2019t have to stop with the wardrobe behind the bed. Extend the wardrobe in the form of cabinetry around the wall folding bed to result in a full-size wardrobe cum bed that will store all your clothes and accessories and double up as a collapsible bed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/17055945\/space-saving-wardrobe-cum-bed-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Wall folding bed design with a wardobe acts as a Murphy bed with invisible storage and space saving technique.\" class=\"wp-image-1763\" title=\"Wardrobe in the form of cabinetry around the wall folding bed to result in a full-size wall mounted murphy bed\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">A smartly designed wardrobe cum bed will provide wall to wall storage space and tremendous bang for your buck<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n<div class=\"mbgc-slide-caption\"><a href=\"#contactUsModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"img-fluid\" alt=\"Modern bedroom interior designs for all home sizes\" src=\"https:\/\/media.designcafe.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/06115218\/modern-bedroom-interior-designs-for-all-home-sizes-scaled.jpg \" \/><\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Also Read:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcafe.com\/blog\/bedroom-interiors\/modern-wardrobe-designs-for-bedroom\/\">Modern Wardrobe Designs For Your Bedroom<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Think Lateral, Think Horizontal With This Wall Mounted Murphy Bed Design<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditionally, Murphy beds were made to be vertically mounted. This option works best if the room that you are looking to install the bed in has sufficiently high ceilings and enough floor space to accommodate the bed when opened. However, if your room has a low ceiling, or if the space available is cramped and awkward, don\u2019t despair just yet. A horizontal Murphy Bed is the answer to your prayers. These are also called loft beds because you guessed it, they are perfect for lofts or rooms with low ceilings.
